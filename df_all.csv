We should focus on AI adotpion rate. And also take close look on innovation and performance plateu moments. Tehe moment doesn't seem to come anytime too soon observing the growth of AI models and sea of innovations. But when the adoption rate becuase large enough for Big-tech to justify the CapEX and when they believe firmly that fundametnal architecture of AI systems will not change or does not have to change, the ASIc adoption will dramatically rise, starting with inference. As inference is less prone to being obsolete compared to training methodologioes. But companies still will invest billions to maintain a edge for when the meoment arrives. Just like google, it provides a great weapon against relying entirely on nvidia and amd for AI workload and can demand more competivie prices on the AI chips with their own in builts available.

0469e9a7-8cae-446a-a8af-bb1c41700bda,"Give me 5 sentences as to why someone should read this report with key ideas:

FY25 was the worst year for our staples coverage in terms of EBITDA growth in over a decade, and the sector will have a favourable base as the year progresses. However, we are not too excited about the optical recovery prospects. In 1QFY26, we expect our staples coverage to see sales growth inch up, helped by inflationary price hikes, but EBITDA margin to be lower y-y for all staples companies. We expect our discretionary and consumer internet coverage to continue to see strong growth. Our preference for affluent consumption continues.

Consumer staples: expect a gradual recovery in sales and EBITDA growth
For our staples coverage, on aggregate we expect sales growth to improve to 7% y-y (ex-ITC) in 1QFY26 vs 5% in 4QFY25, boosted by price hikes taken to counter inflation and a slight recovery in demand. We also expect EBITDA growth to recover in 3-4% vs 0-1% in 2HFY25. We expect Marico and GCPL to outperform within staples. We expect broad-based margin pressure in 1QFY26 but with commodity costs having eased, we expect margin recovery in 2HFY26. Indian FMCG firms have seen broad-based earnings estimate cuts over the last one year, which their stock-price performance has reflected. Despite a slightly improved outlook, we see low valuation comfort in staples.

Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Internet: Strong growth set to continue
We find urban discretionary consumption well placed in FY26 due to lowering of the income-tax rate and interest rates, along with lower food inflation. In 1QFY26, Titan and Jubi have seen 18% y-y sales growth and are factoring in slight margin improvement leading to 20%+ EBITDA growth y-y.

We prefer affluent and discretionary consumption plays
We continue to find a disconnect between the FMCG growth prospects and valuations. Within FMCG, we like the relatively reasonably valued ITC and HUVR. We like Titan but find Jubi expensive and see the high capex and lack of FCF generation as concerns. In Consumer Internet, we like both Eternal and Swiggy for their strong growth and FCF generation prospects.",integrate_search,user,normal,Allie Eom,allie.eom@asia.bnpparibas.com,general,BNP Paribas,,2025-07-10 23:30:19+00:00,active,,2025-06-09,active,

05fe936a-1cf6-4341-a4f5-afc6b98c7363,"Key highlights
The US Fed left policy rates unchanged as markets expected, with the updated FOMC economic projections reflecting tariff effects with slower growth forecasts, higher inflation and slightly higher unemployment rate. However, the updated median dot for end-2025 remained at 3.875%, while the policy rate projection for end-2026 was adjusted upward to 3.625%, implying two 25bp cuts this year, followed by another 25bp cut next year. Fed Chair Powell reiterated the elevated economic uncertainty stemming from policy changes, and the effects will partly depend on the final tariff levels, reinforcing the Fed’s wait-and-see approach. He also stressed the higher tariffs could drive up prices and dampen economic activity. Our base case remains the FOMC will resume rate cuts in September, followed by two additional cuts in December and next March, taking the federal funds target range to 3.50-3.75% by end-2026. We view the Fed’s further easing as a supportive driver for risk assets and continue to adopt a mild risk on portfolio approach. Considering renewed US fiscal policy uncertainty, which could continue to drive rate volatility, we retain our neutral view on US Treasuries and IG bonds.
In Asia, Bank Indonesia (BI) remained on hold as well, pausing its rate-cutting cycle to balance the FX stability and economic growth, amid global trade concerns and geopolitical tensions. On economic outlook, BI anticipates the economy to grow by 4.6% – 5.4% this year, with inflation expected to remain within the 1.5% – 3.5% target range in 2025 and 2026. During the press briefing, Governor Warjiyo addressed the need to further support the domestic economy, with lower bank lending rates to support credit growth and the economy. We anticipate 100bps more of rate cuts by March 2026, bringing the policy rate to 4.50%. We remain neutral on IDR and IDR-denominated government bonds, but would wait for more clarity before turning more constructive on Indonesian stock market. We stay mild underweight on Indonesian stocks on the back of lingering concerns around corporate earnings and political uncertainty.

Both gold and silver prices have been spiking in the global market in the past months.  

Investors chased after precious metals, especially gold, to offset risks from US equities and dollars.  

Also, the demand for silver is increasing rapidly for industrial production of consumer electronics, solar panels, medical devices, auto, 5G products etc.  

And in China, the city of Zhengzhou announced this morning to include gold and jewelry for the consumer subsidy program from Jun 6.  It will be the first time for precious metal consumption to be incorporated into the trade-in ecosystem.

27263b18-f825-4346-af8f-0beb9219bd47,"Derivatives Idea - 3M FCN Linked to Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD UW)

Investment Rationale
•	Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD UW) technologies advance the future of data centres, powering the cloud services that have become an essential part of how consumers work, game, and connect to network, PCs, edge computing, and artificial intelligence (AI). The company offers a deep portfolio of data centre computing solutions including AI accelerators, microprocessors (CPUs), graphic processing units (GPUs) and data processing units (DPUs).
•	AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $7.7 billion, up 3% quarter-on-quarter and 32% year-on-year. AMD forecasts third quarter revenue of $8.7 billion, which would represent growth of 13% quarter-on-quarter and 28% year-on-year.
•	Morningstar Equity Research sees opportunities in AMD through the following drivers: 
o	Gaining market share from Intel: AMD has gained market share in the PC CPU market as Intel’s manufacturing prowess stumbled in recent years. Research models a 15% CAGR in PC CPU client revenue over the next five years as AMD continues to gain market share from Intel.
o	Partnership with TSMC: AMD’s partnership with chip manufacturing leader TSMC and its adoption of a chiplet manufacturing strategy provide the company with greater flexibility in quickly bringing more formidable products to market.
Source: AMD Investor Relations & Morningstar Equity Research 
Structured Product Idea – Fixed Coupon Note (FCN)
•	Investors with a moderately bullish view of the underlying stock(s) may consider the Fixed Coupon Note.
•	Investors will receive periodic coupon as long as the note has not been early redeemed.
•	The note will be early redeemed at par upon the occurrence of a Knock-Out Event.
•	Strike and KI Barrier levels are lower than the Underlying stock price(s) on trade date, providing some buffer against price movements to the downside.

346ac6c2-2eba-4a94-8ee0-be3dd124df20,"Long phases of stability lead to episodes of instability as they encourage a build-up and unwind of leverage. Put another way, the period of ultra-low rates and the behavioural bias that it was a permanent state distorted fiscal behaviour, asset valuations, leverage, and investor expectations. The challenge today is that rates are no longer near zero. Indeed, the real (inflation adjusted) 10-year yield has been around 2% for two years (chart 1). The last time real yields were sustained above 2% was in 2005. That ended with the Great Financial Crisis. Historically, a 2% real yield was probably close to neutral or equilibrium. However, at elevated leverage, 2% real is very taxing.

Business segments. What are the revenue streams of Apple? How bis and significant is each of them? What are their growth rates? The more specific you become in detailing the business segments of Apple the better. Come up with intuitive visual diagrams. Market share starting from 2010~ onwards. 

Financial statement: Give me the visual version of their key KPIs in the financial statements. For example, revenue grouped by geographies. Or number of Iphone sales from 2015~2024 and the projected sales graph. Operating margin vs competitors (for past 10 years), etc. First try to come up with 10 ideas which you think will help me understand the financial position of the company. Then create a visual graph that will deliver the message. 

Supply chain: Give me a map. Supply chain map. Supply chain upstream, mid stream to downstream. I want to be able to understand the entire picture of Apple's supply chain. Also give me their customers as well. Map all together and come up with a visual diagram. I recommend you to come up with a table. You can come up with materials/ components that are necessary. Briefly explain how this is critical for Apple. Mention the criticality of the material. Note the key suppliers and their country. Mention the estimate cost compare to the total expense of apple (yearly). And then based on this, come up with a diagram. Also geographical aspect of the supply chain is the key. 

Geography: Where are Apple producing most of its products? What will happen in the future? Are there any new plans? Where is it being sold? Analyze the geography in depth and provide me with a visual diagram of how Apple has a precense across the world. And also analyze on how trump tariff policies might have an impact on them. Make it breif. More visuals. 

Future prediction: How is buyside positioned, and where do bulls and bears diverge? 

Valuation: What's priced in-- and what would change the multiple? Give me how Apple is usually valued (using which method and which multiples). How does sell side normally value Apple?  

Consumer behavior: Also give me the consumer survey values that are significant to understanding apple. For example, what is the retention rate of Apple customers? How many apple devices do apple user have on average vs samsung (or other peers)? How frequently do Apple users change their devices? How royal are apple users? Why do consumers use apple products (from real surveys)? Find me 10 more such statistics data and give it to me. Don't make the numbers up. Use real survey data. Double check your answers.

Sector: Which sector does Apple operate? What is the TAM? Is the sector increasing or decreasing? At what rate? Are there new catalysts for the sector? How can apple play?

Figma Inc. shares surged as much as 242%
after the design software maker and some of its shareholders
raised $1.2 billion in an IPO, with the trading valuing the
company far above the $20 billion mark it would have reached in
a now-scrapped merger with Adobe Inc.
Shares of the San Francisco-based firm traded at $112.77
each on Thursday as of 2:08 p.m. in New York, well in excess of
an IPO price of $33 apiece, before they were halted a second
time for volatility. The shares were marketed for $30 to $32 per
share, after the company increased the range earlier in the
week.
The company sold 12.47 million shares in the IPO, which
priced Tuesday, while investors including Index Ventures,
Greylock Partners and Kleiner Perkins sold 24.46 million shares.
The trading gives Figma a market value of nearly $55
billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings.
Accounting for employee stock options and restricted stock
units, and restricted stock units for Chief Executive Officer
Dylan Field, which are subject to vesting conditions, the fully
diluted value is well above $65 billion.
The valuation easily trounces the $20 billion valuation
Figma would have fetched in the agreed sale to Adobe that fell
apart in 2023. 
Field’s stake in the company is approaching $4.9 billion at
the last price shares traded at before being halted. The soaring
share price also puts into play the performance-based awards
Field has, including a 10-year “moon-shot” compensation package
awarded just last month that begins to vest once the 60-day
average stock price tops $60. The highest hurdle requires shares
to top $130.

Billion ‘Moon Shot’
The shares offered in Figma’s IPO were ultimately more than
40 times oversubscribed, with more than half of the orders
receiving no stock, Bloomberg News reported. The robust demand
points to a strong open for the first sizable software offering
in the US since SailPoint Inc.’s debut in February.
Figma is used to design web and mobile application
interfaces. It has expanded its suite of products in an attempt
to be more useful for software development and general workplace
collaboration.
Like many software firms, Figma charges clients based on
the number of users and the kind of seat those users have. It
added Dev Mode to the platform in 2023 to enable closer
collaboration with developers, and has more recently
incorporated AI technology into many of its own tools. This year
it introduced Figma Make, an AI-based product that lets the user
turn prompts into functional prototypes.
Now that the company is public, “we have to continue to
sprint, to push hard, and we can’t let the public markets
distract us,” Field said in an interview.
Going public allows Figma to have a big brand moment which
centers the importance of design, Field said. “This is a time
where we can create tremendous value for our community, our
customers, and I think the public market is the right place to
do it.”
The company is growing quickly, with a 46% year on year
increase in first-quarter revenue.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

Figma’s profitability, highlighted by an adjusted gross
margin around 92%, tracks above even its most well-established
software peers, giving the company ample flexibility to invest
in new products and markets.
- Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard, technology analysts

A key question for Figma’s long-term success is whether it
can become a tool used pervasively used by office workers beyond
designers. The company’s suite of tools is seeing strong
adoption by software developers, product managers, and
marketers, said Andrew Reed, a partner at Sequoia Capital and a
member of Figma’s board.
Sequoia, one of the most storied Silicon Valley venture
firms, first invested in Figma in 2019. Around this time,
companies were beginning to adopt Figma’s product en masse, Reed
said.
The use of AI-focused software creation apps which are
potential competitors to Figma, such as Lovable and Bolt, has
rapidly increased this year. Weaving AI features through Figma
is a top priority, Field said. “We have so much room to explore
how we can make great AI products and experiences.”
In a separate interview with Bloomberg TV, Field reiterated
his pledge from the IPO filing’s founder letter that the company
would pursue M&A at scale.
There’s so much out there which can be applicable to the
company in terms of product design and development, he added.
“It has to be an amazing team, an amazing asset, and has to be
something where we think the team is culturally consistent.”

IPO Volume Climbs

The IPO has lifted the volume of first-time share sales on
US exchanges above last year’s pace. There has been more than
$21 billion worth of US first-time share sales in the year to
date, excluding financial vehicles such as blank-check
companies, just behind the $20.2 billion raised in the same
period in 2024, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Demand for Figma’s IPO was likely helped by an order-taking
process similar to an auction. Prospective investors in Figma’s
offering were asked to precisely state the number of shares they
wish to buy and at what price, a person familiar with the matter
has said.

Strong Demand 
Field will continue to control the company with 74.1% of
the votes after the IPO through his holdings of Class B shares
that have 15 votes each, the filings show.
The CEO and fellow Brown University student Evan Wallace
started Figma in 2012. Field attended Brown for two and a half
years before accepting a Thiel Fellowship, the Peter Thiel-
backed program that provides funding to young entrepreneurs,
provided they drop out of school. Figma was widely embraced by
designers who warmed to its browser-based interface, replacing
previous methods of collaboration involving sharing files
individually.

David V Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer:
Thanks Ivan.
Good afternoon and thank you for joining Sandisk's fourth quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings call. Sandisk delivered another strong quarter with revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share exceeding guidance. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion, up 12% over the prior quarter with both Bit shipments and ASPs up mid-single digits. Non-GAAP earnings for the quarter were $0.29 per share.
During the quarter, we reduced our inventory from 150 to 135 days and reduced our net debt to $368 million. We remain on track toward reaching our goal of becoming net cash positive. In our fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate that overall demand exceeded supply, which we anticipate to continue through calendar year 2026. Data center demand remains strong, supported by robust capital investment from leading cloud providers.
In the client end market, growth was primarily driven by rising average capacity across mobile and PC markets. Overall we close fiscal 2025 strong, and while we are optimistic about the future for fiscal '26, we will continue to manage the business prudently. Fiscal year '26 marks a pivotal transition as BiCS8 becomes our prominent node. We've made strong progress ramping up this industry-leading node into high-volume manufacturing.
BiCS8 delivers best-in-class performance, density, and power efficiency capabilities that are critical across a wide range of end markets, including hyperscale data centers, PCs, mobile, and gaming. While the nodal transition brings above-average capital intensity and below-average cost reductions in the near-term, we expect this to be a year of significant financial improvement, with both expanding margins and cash generation, as macro headwinds subside and the demand and supply dynamics remain favorable. Our leadership with BiCS8 reflects years of focused investment and disciplined engineering execution, and we are well positioned to continue and extend that lead. Moving on to key business highlights.
In the fourth quarter, data center represented over 12% of our total bid ship, a meaningful milestone as we scale in this critical part of the market. We continue to make steady progress in both storage enterprise SSDs intended for fast AI data lakes and compute enterprise SSDs intended for compute-heavy applications. We are proud to announce a 256-terabyte NVMe enterprise SSD powered by our industry-leading UltraQLC platform, which we unveiled at the Future of Memory and Storage Conference. With this product, we are setting a new benchmark in performance, capacity, and efficiency for AI-driven workloads.
This breakthrough reflects our deep commitment to helping customers accelerate their most demanding data challenges with scalable next-generation flash solutions. Our plan is to qualify our high-capacity UltraQLC platform at several major tier one customers by the end of fiscal year 2026. On the compute enterprise SSD front, we are encouraged by the progress we have made in qualifying solutions with key customers, including an ongoing qualification with the second major hyperscaler and other customers using the NVIDIA GB300. Customer feedback has been consistently positive, particularly regarding TLCs performance and efficiency in high-throughput, read-intensive applications.
Expansion into the data center space requires sustained effort given its long qualification cycles. We are progressing in line with our expectations in enterprise SSD, and our strategy is anchored in the adoption of QLC-based SSDs and PCIe Gen 5 and Gen 6 solutions with our UltraQLC platform, a technology designed to support the scale and density of fast data lakes needed for AI and other data-intensive workloads. Cloud infrastructure spending remains significant, with industry analysts estimating major US Hyperscale CapEx growing 47% year-over-year to $368 billion, alongside rising investments in Asia and Europe. Our full-stack portfolio, from advanced NAND components to high-capacity SSDs, is well aligned with the evolving needs of cloud and AI infrastructure customers.
With BiCS8 scaling, continued traction in PCIe Gen 5 and QLC, and accelerating global AI workloads, we are confident in our ability to drive sustained growth in this end market, and earn our fair and growing share in this fast-evolving space. In client, BiCS8 SSDs are now qualified across all major PC OEMs, with additional qualifications underway. As the market transitions towards QLC, our differentiated CMOS Bonded Array architecture and system-level capabilities give us a competitive advantage. In addition, in mobile, we secured shipment approvals from key customers for our next-generation storage solutions, targeting the premium portion of the market.
Our continued innovation in flash-based storage is driving positive customer response across channels. In consumer, we continue to strengthen the SanDisk brand through differentiated product innovation. Our BiCS5 technology is showing healthy consumption, supported by solid channel sell-through and seasonal strength so far this calendar year. Meanwhile, our new SanDisk USB 4 Portable SSD is recognized as one of the fastest solutions on the market, delivering exceptional performance and reliability for content creators, gamers, and everyday users.
We are deepening strategic partnerships with industry leaders, including Nintendo and Xbox. Our co-branded MicroSD Express card for the Nintendo Switch 2 is gaining adoption, and the new C50 expansion card for Xbox reinforces our leadership in gaming storage. We are also expanding into emerging high-growth markets with targeted solutions, including a new high-performance USB drive designed for DJs and creative professionals. These efforts reflect our commitment to product innovation, which continues to drive positive customer response across high-value, growing consumer use cases.
Looking beyond our current product portfolio, we are also investing in innovations that will redefine the future of memory and storage technology. During our Investor Day in February, we unveiled our high-bandwidth flash memory technology, which we trademarked as HBF We are proud to announce that just last week at FMS, HBF receives the Best of Show Award in the Most Innovative Technology category. We have made significant progress advancing this groundbreaking technology over the last six months. First, we established a technical advisory board, including industry experts and senior technical leaders from within and outside of SanDisk.
Second, we formed an ecosystem partnership with SK Hynix to standardize HBF technology specifications. And third, we announced that we expect to have HBF technology available by the second half of calendar year 2026, and product samples, including the controller device, in the first half of '27. We are very optimistic about this technology and the opportunity it is expected to create as AI continues to proliferate. With that, I'll turn it over to Luis for our financial results and guidance.

Luis Visoso, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, David. Let's start by diving deeper into the quarter financials. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion, up 12% quarter-over-quarter and 8% year-over-year. Sequentially, bid shipments and average selling prices were up mid-single digits.
Our performance was above our guidance range of $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion, primarily from better-than-expected Bit growth. For fiscal year 2025, revenue was $7.355 billion, up 10% from fiscal year 2024. Cloud revenue for the fourth quarter was $213 million, up 8% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. Client revenue was $1.103 billion, up 19% sequentially and 3% year-over-year.
Consumer revenue was $585 million, up 2% quarter-over-quarter and 12% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 26.4%. Within our guidance range of 25.5% to 27%, and up 370 basis points from the prior quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter includes $51 million in underutilization charges and $42 million in FAB startup costs. Excluding these charges, our non-GAAP gross margin would have been 31.3%. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $402 million, in line with our guidance range of $395 million to $405 million. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.29, above our guidance range from a loss of $0.10 to a profit of $0.15. The Bit was primarily from the additional revenue flowing through to the bottom line.
Key GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation items include stock-based compensation, which represents 2.6% of revenue, $17 million in separation charges, and $16 million in restructuring charges, as we reduced our workforce by approximately 200 employees. Moving on to the balance sheet, we closed the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash-and-cash equivalents. During the quarter, we reduced our inventory days from $150,000 to $135,000 as demand exceeded supply, in line with our strategy. During the quarter, we also made our first quarterly $5 million Term loan B payment and prepaid an additional $95 million, reducing our long-term debt to $1.8 billion.
For perspective, we prepaid an additional $100 million of the Term Loan B after the fourth quarter closed. These repayments reflect our confidence in our future cash flow expectations, which includes funding our BiCS8 investment. We closed the fourth quarter with 147 million fully diluted shares. Moving on to free cash flow.
During the quarter, we generated $77 million in adjusted free cash flow. This included $94 million from operations and $28 million cash received from our activities related to Flash Ventures, partially offset by $45 million invested in our back-end operations and offices. The $28 million received from our operations related to Flash Ventures includes $343 million in gross capital spending, with $109 million funded through depreciation as part of our cost of goods sold, $262 million funded from external sources, mainly subsidies and equipment leasing from the joint venture. Before moving on to guidance, I want to reinforce that our goal is to create value for our customers and shareholders.
We will continue to innovate to drive performance, density, and power efficiency while managing supply in line with demand. This includes adjusting wafer starts, underutilizing fabs when needed to align with demand, and planning capacity based on expected demand growth and node productivity. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we also began implementing price increases. Several of our products are on allocation, and we expect mid-single-digit undersupply for the fiscal 2026, supporting further price increases. We anticipate our bid's growth in fiscal 2026 to be consistent with broader demand growth. We will continue to adjust supply based on market conditions, with an emphasis on driving healthy and sustainable profitability levels. With that, let's move on to the first quarter guide. We expect revenue for the first quarter to be $2.10 billion to $2.20 billion.
The midpoint of the revenue guide is up 13% growth quarter over quarter. We expect revenue growth to come from Bit's growth and higher average selling prices with similar contributions from both drivers. We expect non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter to be between 28.5% and 29.5%, which includes $10 million to $15 million in underutilization charges, and approximately $60 million in type startup costs. At midpoint, non-GAAP gross margins are expected to increase by another 260 basis points quarter-to-quarter, mostly from higher pricing.
We expect top startup costs to reduce significantly as of the third quarter. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter to be between $415 million and $430 million, non-GAAP interest and other income and expenses to be between $40 million and $45 million, and non-GAAP taxes to be between $35 million and $40 million. Higher operating expenses compared to the prior quarter are due to an additional week in the quarter and one-time costs associated with qualification samples for our expanding product portfolio. Combined, the impact of these two costs is between $20 million and $25 million.
As a result, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.70 and $0.90 based on 148 million fully diluted shares. Free cash flow for the quarter is expected to be positive. This includes an increase of gross capital spending to support our Big Save program and a reduction in our days of inventory. As a result, we expect our net debt to continue to decline.
With that, let me turn the call back to David.

David V Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer:
Thanks, Luis. In conclusion, as we enter fiscal year '26, we see momentum in our product portfolio, in improving supply and demand environment, and early benefits from our pricing actions. We're evolving from a model driving elasticity-based TAM growth to one focused on creating value from our innovation in combination with disciplined capacity management. Ultimately, the steps we are taking today are not just supporting quarterly financial improvements. They are laying the groundwork for a stronger, more resilient SanDisk built for long-term success and value creation for our shareholders, as well as enabling us to drive value for customers long-term. With that, let's open the call for questions.

Questions And Answers

Operator:
Question And Answer

Operator:
Thank you.
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question comes from C J Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald.
Please go ahead.

C J Muse:
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess I was hoping to spend a little bit of time giving more depth on gross margins. Obviously, great guide, 260 bps higher, but I think less than expectations. So if you could kind of walk through underutilization, cost downs, mix, anything that could be helpful. Thanks so much.

Unidentified Speaker, :
Yes, thank you, C J As you saw, underutilization is moving lower and lower. Now we are forecasting it to be between $10 million and $15 million in the quarter, which is significantly down from what we had in Q4. Really, the biggest impact on gross margin this quarter is startup costs, right? Startup costs are somewhere around $60 million, which continue to impact us in the quarter. If you look at both together, underutilization of startup costs for the quarter, it's about 300 basis points. And the good news is they will go away, right? These costs are coming down.
They will be reduced next quarter and will be significantly reduced in Q3. So we'll continue to see those 300 basis points kind of flowing to our gross margin as we go forward.

C J Muse:
Very helpful. And then just -- Okay, thanks.

Operator:
Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Joseph Moore:
Great. Thank you.
I wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on the high-balance-flash partnership. I guess, what's the thought process behind partnering and how do you extract them all together?

Unidentified Speaker, :
Hey, Joe. Good to hear from you. Yes, we're very excited about this. We introduced. We've been working on this technology for a while. I think we are all looking at the AI architecture and understanding what are good ways to optimize it. We view it as a memory-bound problem and have been looking for how we can bring flash to this equation with our scalability roadmap. And as we talked about our investor day, we think we've found a way to design flash where we can overcome the bandwidth or achieve the bandwidth requirements that we need. And so, we've been driving this forward. And I think what we really want to do is drive this as an industry standard. And when Hynix contacted us and had the same goal of saying, hey, let's see how we can take this technology and make it a standard.
I think anything in this industry that has this broad of applicability, this is a technology that can play from the edge. So, PCs, smartphones, all the way into the cloud for inference. We think it's a new paradigm for how inference is driven. And the ability, all customers are going to look for that as an industry standard.
And we think that's how we move this the fastest and how we drive it forward. We've got a controller to design and all the interfaces to standardize around that. And doing it with an industry partner, we think, is the right way to go to move this along and drive adoption as quickly as possible. And quite frankly, we think the industry is going to need this kind of capacity in the memory architecture to drive inference at scale.
So that's a little more background for you.

Joseph Moore:
Great, and your confidence in this kind of being commercially viable next year from a sampling perspective is this, how speculative should we view these investments as being at this point?

Unidentified Speaker, :
Well, I mean, Joe, what we said is next year we'll be sampling the die for the NAND, and then early '27 we'll have the controller that goes along with that. So we've been building NAND die for '25 years now, so we have a lot of history in that. It is a development project, so there's always uncertainty and unknowns, but we know how to manage through those.
And I think one of the things folks have been asking us since our investor day was to put some timelines around this and give us a better idea of how this technology is going to evolve, and we've seen a lot of progress since then over the last five months. So we feel very comfortable putting those dates out, and we've got teams working aggressively towards those milestones.

Joseph Moore:
Great, thank you.

Unidentified Speaker, :
Thanks, Joe, appreciate it.

Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Aaron Rakers:
Yes, thanks for taking the question, guys. I guess I want to go back to C J's question a little bit.
Appreciating the inputs in the gross margin, I know, Luis, you had mentioned that the startup cost of $60 million, looks like it's up from the $42 million this last quarter, but you did suggest that that should decline significantly going forward. Any kind of glide path of how we should think about that $60 million as we look out over the next couple quarters? And then, I guess also tied to the gross margin, I guess if I back those items out, I adjust, it looks like your rate of cost down relative to the BiCS8 ramp, I'm just curious, like, that seems to be a bit of a headwind. When do we start to see maybe that cost curve start to normalize and you start to see the benefits of that cost down from BiCS8? Thank you.

Luis Visoso, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
So thank you for the question. I -- what you should expect is, call it two steps as we go down from the startup cost, a significant step down next quarter, and then even a further step down in Q3, in our fiscal Q3. So expect two steps to get very close to minimal impacts on startup costs. So that's kind of what you should expect there.
Underutilization, expect unless the dynamics change in the market, it should be pretty close to zero going forward. As you saw, our inventory levels are coming down. I also mentioned that we're seeing, , some of our products are actually on allocation because we're seeing a good market. As David mentioned, we see an undersupply situation there.
So we're feeling good there. In terms of ongoing savings at the end of the day, the way you bring cost per gigabyte down is through no transitions, right? And the no transition that we are going through is as we implement BiCS8 we mentioned that Q4 we closed about 7% of our Bits were BiCS8, and we will be somewhere between 40% and 50% by the end of fiscal year '26. So that's when you will start to see the impact and the benefit of that transition throughout the year as we continue to change our mix into from BiCS6 towards BiCS8. Hopefully that helps.

Aaron Rakers:
Yes. That does. And then real quickly, you mentioned growing BiCS growth consistent with the broader demand of the market. Can you just remind us of what that growth is, the broader market demand?

David V Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer:
So, Aaron, we see '25, we see demand low double-digits -- very low double-digits with supply under that.
And then we see that moving up to mid to high double digits in calendar year '26, but we still see demand below that. We mentioned that in the prepared remarks that we continue to see this undersupplied market through the end of '26. I think the last quarter played out as we thought back at our investor day. We're optimistic on the second half, and then as we go into '26, we still see when you look at the whole year production demand, we see more demand than supply.
So we feel very good about the market. And just to comment on your first part of your question, Luis did a great job with it. But we're clearly in a state where we have some headwinds on the cost side. We're doing we're going through a fab startup, which is a pretty big episodic event, which we have, we drive through we've been on BiCS5 for quite some time.
It was still the predominant node last quarter. It's been a fantastic node for us, the highest yielding node in the history of BiCS But now we're going to go -- we're going to go through a year here where we start with BiCS8 mid single-digits percent of the portfolio and roughly end with it as half. So we're going to have that be a tailwind to the business as we mix into a more efficient node. And then we're going to have the startup cost, as Luis talked about, step down over the last, over the next couple of quarters.
So we're going to turn what have been headwinds in the business into tailwinds and all of that against the backdrop of a very, what we see as a favorable supply and demand environment.

Aaron Rakers:
Thanks, David.

David V Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer:
Thanks, Aaron, appreciate it.

Operator:
Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.
Please go ahead.

Analyst:
Yes. Thank you so much. How are you thinking about the growth in client in the second half of the calendar year, given some of the so it happened here in the first half.

David V Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer:
Hey, Wamsi. We've seen very consistent behavior out of these customers, right? I mean, we've been seeing consistent demand. Maybe there was some pull ahead early in the tariff days. But the market has absorbed that.
And as we look into the second half, we see pretty consistent demand from the signals our customers are sending us. So again, the overall backdrop is we see a undersupplied market. And we see consistent demand from those customers. And we also believe that their inventory levels have been normalized.
So we don't see a lot of big distortions on the market here as we move through the second half.

Analyst:
You also just mentioned tariffs. Can you talk about how you're thinking strategically about tariffs on semis, particularly given that your fab footprint is kind of all Japan? So how are you thinking about navigating that, given some of the comments we've heard lately?

David V Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer:
Yes, we're staying, Wamsi, obviously we're staying very, very close to that. I mean, I think the NAND business in general is a very dynamic business. It's something you've got to stay very close to on a day-to-day basis. And tariffs are another thing that are part of that equation. We stay very close to that. We have conversations with all the right folks we need to to understand, get the best view possible of where this is all going to land. It is pretty dynamic right now. I think the big issue for us, of course, is the 232% tariffs that we still have yet to see. So when we see those, then we'll have more to say about how do we respond to it. But we're very confident in our ability to navigate this whole situation with our global footprint.

Analyst:
Okay, thanks, Dave.

David V Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer:
Thanks, Wamsi, appreciate it.

Operator:
Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Please go ahead.

Vijay Rakesh:
Yes, hi, David and Luis. Just a quick question on the data center side. Obviously, it looks like you're ramping your 256 gig QLC SSD because your target family, I guess. Can you talk to how the roadmap looks? You obviously have a second hyperscaler you're qualifying.
But what's the target that you're trying to get to by the end of fiscal 2026 in terms of number of hyperscalers or your mix of data center, I think you mentioned 12% of bits. But where do you see that going?

Unidentified Speaker, :
Yes, I mean, our goal, we've been pretty consistent. This is an area where we want to increase our optionality and be able to mix up, at least to our fair share of the market, if not more. It's a market where there's long development cycles.
We have a previous generation of products in the market that we've been driving over the last several years that have been performing. And now we have the next generation of products coming out on the compute side. We've been talking about that for two or three quarters. We've got good traction with one hyperscaler.
We're qualifying a second right now. And then to your point, we were very happy to announce at FMS the actual in our booth, we had the 256-terabyte StarGrade platform drive. People could come and see it and touch it and see the performance. And that product is just now going into the first customer's hands.
And so from there, you go into a qualification process, which would be six to 12 months. So it's an evolving story, but we feel very good about where we're at. We think with our new development, we're moving on to the front foot as far as the availability of our products at the right capacity points as the market transitions. And as we go through '26, I think we'll see a ramping set of qualifications first, and then we'll start to see the revenue ramp behind that.

Vijay Rakesh:
Got it. And then just a quick follow-up for Luis. Luis, I think you mentioned to enact the previous question of 300 bps underutilization. Should we expect that to completely come off by your fiscal Q3? So over the next two quarters, I guess, you should see a pricing tailwind to margins and that underutilization coming down.
Is that how we should look at it? Thanks.

Luis Visoso, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Just to make sure you have the right numbers, right? So underutilization was about $50 million in Q4. What I'm saying is going to be between $10 million, $15 million in Q1, and I would expect it to be very close to zero thereafter.
Obviously, we're going to adjust, as I said, based on supply and demand, because we believe that that's where we need to be supply and demand balance or slightly undersupplied. So we'll continue to manage towards that. The number that comes down over time is a startup cost, right? Q4 was about $42 million. Q1, we're guiding somewhere around $60 million.
And then as I mentioned, expect this to come down in two steps in Q2 and Q3 being minimal.

Vijay Rakesh:
Got it. Thank you.

Luis Visoso, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Does that help?

Vijay Rakesh: Yes.
Yes. Very much. Thanks.

Luis Visoso, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.

David V Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer:
Thank you.

Operator:
Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.

Karl Ackerman:
Yes, thank you.
I have two, if I may. Could you talk about the average capacity trends you are seeing across flagship mobile in the second half of this calendar year, as well as content growth of conventional Windows 11 PCs and AI-enabled PCs that support your view for demand to outstrip supply into fiscal '26?

Unidentified Speaker, :
Yes, we're. As we look at '25, we see average capacity in smartphones up high single digits and in '26, a little tick above that. And PCs, we see average capacity in '25 up mid-single digit and then as we go into '26 up, mid-to-high single digits.
So, in '26, we see higher average capacity per unit across both smartphones and PCs.

Karl Ackerman:
Very helpful, David. For my quick follow-up, given the comments that you made about within Enterprise SSD, should we expect your datacenter SSD business to grow more than twice the demand you expect overall in fiscal '26, given the cloud investment and visibility they may be giving you today? Thank you.

David V Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer:
Yes, we're not going to forecast for the whole year, but we, look, Karl, we feel really good about where the portfolio is and the customers are pulling it in.
I think you may have caught in Luis's comments, one of the things that's happening this quarter is we've got a little extra OpEx that we're going to spend because the number of units we need for qualifications is higher than we expected, which is an investment we'll make at any time. So the qualification process in this market and these size drives is very this is a new platform, so it's a significant process, but the good news of that is once you get through it, then there's significant consumption on the other side. So we'll give you updates as we go throughout as we go throughout the fiscal year and then beyond of kind of how we're doing on those qualifications and what we expect in revenue growth. But we certainly are confident in the product.
We're seeing very good response from customers, and we look forward to getting to the point where we have the optionality to mix higher into this part of the market, depending on what the market gives us. I think, as you know, we already have a great portfolio in consumer. We have a great portfolio in gaming. We have a really strong position in client. We're going to fill out this part of the portfolio, and we'll be in a really good spot that no matter what the market presents us, we'll be able to mix into the best return for our shareholders.

Karl Ackerman:
Very clear. Thanks.

David V Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer:
Thank you, Karl.

Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.

Analyst:
Hey, guys. This is Eddie for Krish.
One of your main peers is reported to be exiting the China NAND market, specifically in mobile. I wonder what's your exposure to China today and what end markets you have biggest exposure to, and if you have any views to share about the competitive dynamics in China, that would be helpful.

David V Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer:
Yes, I mean, we play across the wide range of markets, the global markets. I mean, I don't tend to think about them about one country at a time, but I think everybody has to decide what the mix of their portfolio is going to be. And it doesn't surprise me that people make decisions of markets to enter and exit. We see China as an attractive market for us. We have a lot of partners there. Obviously, it's a good consumer market for us as well.
So I think that's something one of our peers decided to do. But for us, this is an important part of the market.

5d627aac-887c-4ea2-87f3-0ff939811e22,"Please help summarize this essay delivered by HSAI‘s board of director: Every era presents unique industry opportunities, yet only the companies that tackle
significant social challenges leave a lasting imprint on history. Since its inception in
2014, Hesai has embraced the mission of ""Empower Robotics, Elevate Lives."" Dedicated
to harnessing cutting-edge LiDAR solutions, Hesai is spearheading the future of robotics,
striving for a better, safer and more efficient world.
LiDAR's transformative influence on society has propelled its evolution from a
standalone product to an entire industry.
We are accelerating the advancement and adoption of intelligent driving technologies
through our LiDAR products. This contributes to establishing safe, efficient and ecofriendly
transportation systems. Globally, over 1.3 million lives are lost annually in
traffic accidents, and human factors such as drunk driving or fatigue accounting for
90% of the traffic accidents. Studies indicate that intelligent driving solutions equipped
with LiDAR can reduce severe accident rates by up to 20% compared to human drivers.
By providing industry-leading LiDAR products, we enhance road safety, substantially
reducing the risks of traffic accidents and fostering overall traffic safety. Simultaneously,
addressing transportation's impact on the climate is imperative. Statistics show that
the transportation sector contributes roughly 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Hesai is committed to promoting the adoption of intelligent electric vehicles, facilitating
the smart and sustainable transition of transportation systems, and substantially
reducing emissions in the global transportation sector.
Looking forward, we aspire to leverage our technology to empower robotics solutions
across diverse fields, positively impacting lives. With over 30 million truck drivers.10 million couriers and 7 million food delivery riders in China alone, labor-intensive
industries face considerable challenges amidst an aging population, declining birth rates
and rising labor costs. We aim to enhance workers' productivity and job satisfaction by
using advanced robotics technology to liberate them from inefficient and hazardous
work conditions, while also improving the quality of life for the elderly, assisting disabled
individuals, and supporting various other vulnerable groups, ultimately increasing overall
human satisfaction.
These challenges underscore the urgency for safer, more sustainable intelligent driving
and robotics solutions. They also reinforce our belief that our endeavors will yield
enduring social benefits.
We embrace our responsibility and navigate uncharted paths. Hesai's success today
stems from our unwavering commitment to R&D and innovation. By consistently
investing in R&D, we have overcome cutting-edge technologies, consolidating a robust
technological foundation to shape long-term competitiveness. Through independent
ASIC development, we have successfully reduced product size and cost while notably
enhancing performance. These endeavors have dramatically propelled LiDAR technology
promotion and intelligent driving development.
Driven by aspiration and grounded determination, ensuring timely and high-quality
deliveries of LiDAR products is pivotal to fulfilling our mission. We have implemented
highly automated production lines, overseeing every production phase to optimize
processes promptly and meet global customers' demands for fast-paced, top-quality
mass production deliveries of LiDAR products. Our vision is to enable 3D perception for
1% of all vehicles by 2025, and we are steadily progressing toward this target. By the end
of 2023, our cumulative LiDAR product shipments surpassed 300,000 units, marking a
significant milestone for Hesai and a notable stride in driving LiDAR industry development.
Cultivate ourselves and take the lead. To showcase our commitment to environmental
and social responsibilities comprehensively while safeguarding stakeholders' interests,
Hesai has issued its inaugural annual ESG report. We strive to lead by example,
continuously enhancing our ESG management system, infusing ESG principles into
our business operations and development decisions, and bolstering our sustainable
development capabilities. We prioritize talent attraction, development and retention,
fostering employee engagement, satisfaction and a sense of belonging. Emphasizing
product and production safety, as well as information security management, our goal
is to establish the industry's most advanced safety management certification system,
spearheading the formulation of standards and norms in the LiDAR industry. Additionally,
we seek to improve resource utilization efficiency and actively explore renewable energy
solutions from production onset to tackle essential ecological and environmental
challenges such as climate change. Through these efforts, we aspire to become a leader
in sustainable development, establishing a new benchmark in the LiDAR industry.
Our goals are both ambitious and humble. We aim to leverage our technological
prowess to address critical social challenges, exploring the nexus of technological
innovation and social advancement while creating enduring business and social
values. Committed to close collaboration with stakeholders, we jointly pursue excellence
in products and services, empower safer global transportation, drive advancements in
robotics, and ultimately contribute to elevating the quality of human life.",integrate_search,user,normal,Ray Kwok,ray.kwok@cgsi.com,general,CGS International,34065.0,2025-06-30 01:08:21+00:00,active,,2025-06-10,,

63c23cdb-67b3-4365-a5f3-d5e7b174485b,"Please help write a short paragraph for the China's ADAS chips technological breakthrough, within 100-200words, summarizing below's information, make it precise and concide, with professional and formal analytical tone, while without compromising the key contents and data.

AI Chips Powering ADAS Technologies. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems rely heavily on specialized AI accelerator chips that can process massive amounts of data from multiple sensors in real-time. These specialized semiconductors are designed to handle the complex computational workloads required for perception, decision-making, and control functions in autonomous vehicles.
China's domestic semiconductor industry is making significant strides in ADAS chip development, with several companies emerging as key players. Horizon Robotics stands out as one of the most advanced domestic providers, having shipped over 8m AI processors to date and developed a global ecosystem of more than 200 expert partners. 
Horizon’s Journey series of processors, particularly Journey 6, represents the cutting edge of Chinese automotive AI chip design. Its most recent J6 chips are able to meet the requirements for all-scenario navigate on autopilot (NOA) functionality with maximum 560TOPS computing power and can support up to L4 autonomous driving scenarios. While it trails NVIDIA’s (e.g., Orin X’s 254 TOPS and Thor-U’s 700 TOPS) chips in terms of raw power, Horizon’s offerings ease OEMs’ spell out (BOM) pressures. By leveraging localised supply chains and optimised hardware-software integration, it cuts both chip costs and overall system expenses, making advanced ADAS features more accessible for mass market vehicles (price segment below Rmb200k).
 Horizon Robotics has already seen commercial success with its earlier chips, with the Journey 2 being used in more than 30 vehicle models including those from Changan, Chery, and SAIC11. 
The development of specialized chips is a critical enabler for autonomous driving systems. China has made significant strides in this area, with companies like Huawei and Baidu developing high-performance computing chips. These chips are designed to handle the immense computational requirements of autonomous driving, supporting real-time data processing and AI algorithms.

As LiDAR can significantly enhance the ADAS features and safety, a growing number of OEMs, particularly in China, have already adopted LiDAR as the perception solutions of their vehicle models. Driven by the preference of Chinese customers towards more advance autonomous driving functions, as well as the rapid iteration of vehicle models by the Chinese OEMs, the penetration rate of ADAS is expected to increase significantly in China over the next few years. Thanks to rapid penetration of ADAS in China, LiDAR market growth in China has outpaced the U.S. in 2021, with more than 400k ADAS vehicles equipped with Chinese LiDAR, while in 2026, the LiDAR penetration rate is anticipated to occupy over half of the global market, further solidifying its leading position as LiDAR hub.

7117f1dd-ca9b-4670-abfd-655071068c12,"Below is some extracts from various publications. Base on these and your research, give me a list of reasons to buy gold: Trust and deficits drive gold
We retain our bullish view on gold due to trade policy risks, alongside persistent geopolitical risks and ongoing concerns over the unsustainable nature of the US fiscal position, particularly given the impact of these risks on consumer confidence and business investment intentions. 
As the Federal Reserve guides further rate cuts in 2025 and 2026, money market yields are expected to decline further.This should diminish the appeal of cash-like instruments, reducing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold.
A sharply declining US dollar trend and a potentially dovish Fed pivot in 2H 2025 could help gold take some incremental allocation share from the record ~US$7 Trillion parked in money market mutual funds.As the dollar weakens, the relative purchasing power of cash erodes strengthening the case for hard assets like gold as both a store of value and portfolio diversifier.
Recent Fed easing cycles (e.g., 2001, 2008, 2019-2020) were followed by robust upward momentum in gold,demonstrating its effectiveness as a portfolio hedge during monetary transitions.
In fact, we have already seen a resumption of ETF net buying alongside the covering of previously built-up short positions by speculators.
Meanwhile, the World Gold Council’s Central Bank Gold Reserves Survey signals that most reserve managers intend to purchase more gold into 2026 as concerns persist over the US fiscal deficit, USD weakness, and apprehension about the US administration, including the independence of US monetary policy.
We forecast central banks will buy over 1,000 metric tons of gold again this year, double the rate of the decade ending in 2021. We also see a 5% allocation within a diversified portfolio as optimal.

7fd58a12-0750-420a-87a1-679c0701e25e,"Can you summarize following into 1 paragraph with conclusion in beginning?

We think Q2 GDP data sent promising signals, as witnessed by the rebound in private consumption. Based on the trend of high frequency data, we think private consumption is likely to rise further in Q3, also supported by the second supplementary budget. Still, we think it is not enough to rule out concerns about the economy, given still wide output gap, as BoK had mentioned in the July MPB meeting (Bank of Korea: Dilemma between financial stability and growth, dated 24 July). 

We currently forecast 2025-26 GDP growth at 1.0% and 1.7%, respectively. After the Q2 GDP data, we view the risks around our 2025 GDP growth forecasts as balanced, while 2026 is tilted to the upside. GDP growth will need to register average 0.8% q/q sa in the remaining two quarters to achieve 1.0% annual growth in 2025. Meanwhile, we think Bank of Korea is likely to raise its 2025-26 GDP growth forecasts by around 0.1~0.2pp, reflecting better than its expected Q2 GDP growth (0.5%) and the effects of the second supplementary budget. Still, we think such views are highly uncertain and subject to the progress of trade negotiations with the US. For instance, in its economic forecasts in May, BoK had assumed 15% overall US effective tariff rates and 15% effective tariff rate on South Korea.  

South Korea’s Q2 GDP growth rebounded to 0.6% q/q sa and 0.5% y/y from -0.2% q/q sa and 0.0% y/y a quarter ago. The reading was higher than Bloomberg consensus (0.5% q/q sa and 0.4% y/y), but slightly below our expectations (0.7% q/q sa and 0.6% y/y).

8139d9bb-fe1d-42e2-a449-c5ba6e8a9a28,"correct the grammar; Continued focus on asset quality improvements 
●	BBRI’s provisions grew 28.6% yoy to Rp38.2tr in FY24 due to asset quality issues in 1H24, mainly from the Kupedes (non-subsidised micro loans) disbursed in 2023. Since then, the bank has implemented a more stringent approach in its underwriting and business processes. Hence, 4Q24 CoC improved to 2.76% (-47bp qoq in 4Q24, FY24: 3.23%).
●	As of Dec 24, BBRI had a provision overlay of Rp3.6tr. Excluding this, CoC would have been 2.96% in FY24 (bank only CoC excluding overlay: 2.87%). The overlay is mainly related to the restructured Kupedes loans from 2023 disbursements.
●	During its FY24 analyst call in Feb 2025, management said CoC and provisions could spike as it plans to frontload in early-2025F. However, it expects this to gradually improve over the year.
●	BBRI targets a CoC of 3-3.2% for FY25F, which already reflects the same level of provision overlay and corporate loan modification loss as in FY24.
Key ESG initiatives and achievements
●	Environment aspect: As of 1Q25, 64.2% of BBRI’s total loan and corporate bond investments which amounted to Rp796tr are allocated to sustainable sectors, including MSMEs, green sectors, and ESG-based bonds. Other than sustainable financing, BBRI has issued multiple green and social bonds, including: 1) Green Bond Phase I of Rp5tr, 2) Green Bond Phase II of Rp2.5tr, and 3) Social loan of US$800m. 
●	Social aspect: According to BBRI’s sustainability report FY24, BBRI involve in community empowerment programs include Desa BRILiaN, Klasterku Hidupku, and LinkUMKM, fostering sustainable rural economies and supporting over 4,327 villages and 39,866 business clusters in FY2024.
●	Governance aspect: In 2024, BRI further refined its Integrated Governance framework, established a structured parenting style for managing subsidiary companies, and conducted comprehensive evaluations to assess the maturity level of integrated governance implementation.
Reiterate Add, with a GGM-based TP of Rp4,900
●	We reiterate our Add rating with a GGM-based TP of Rp4,900 (trading at 1.7x FY26F P/BV). Re-rating catalysts: stronger loan growth and better credit cost. Downside risks: deterioration of loan quality and persistent challenges in deposit liquidity.

It has secured design wins with 22 OEMs across over 120 vehicle models in 2024, the company said. 
Hesai’s global leadership is supported by its in-house ASIC chip development and highly automated intelligent production at scale, which create synergy and economy of scales for the company.

835f6255-6b52-4278-ab61-02f309fb32ae,"Please help to write a paragraph summarizing below's information within 100 words: 5.1	China’s LiDAR demand surging: from premium to mainstream   Section 5 is ddited by Kwan Por 
Global LiDAR market is experiencing hypergrowth. We estimate that the global LiDAR market will grow from Rmb33.2bn in 2024 to Rmb1,000bn by 2030F, representing a 77% CAGR (Fig x), driven by increased ADAS deployment in passenger vehicles (PVs), a rapidly growing smart EV market, and falling sensor costs. Moreover, we anticipate that the China LiDAR market, accounting for 35% of Global market in 2030F, will grow at a 73% CAGR to Rmb347bn by 2030F, up from Rmb12.8bn in 2024 (Fig. x). 
According to Yole Group, LiDAR installations in China reached 1.6m units in 2024, accounting for 12% of China’s NEV shipments. 
Democratisation is accelerating. LiDAR nowadays has expanded from premium models (Rmb300k and above) into the mass market segment (Rmb150k – Rmb250k vehicles) and even select Rmb100k EVs in China, while vision-only ADAS has now penetrated the Rmb100k–200k segments. Chinese automakers deliver advanced ADAS capabilities in the mass market, underpinned by aggressive ""chipification/digitalisation"" that have slashed LiDAR costs, which have declined by more than 40% from end-2023 to approximately Rmb15,000 to Rmb3,000 in Jun 2025 – check Sera. 
5.2	China is leading in LiDAR ecosystem   
China has established a solid leadership in the global LiDAR ecosystem. We believe China's dominance stems from a number of strategic advantages: 1) manufacturing capability, 2) government support, and 3) industry dividends from rapid technology breakthroughs in ADAS and robotaxi applications in China.
1)	Manufacturing capability. Leading Chinese manufacturers, such as Hesai and RoboSense, have been actively increasing their yearly capacity, with an expectation of exceeding 1m units by 2025F, accounting for more than 60% of the passenger vehicle (PV) LiDAR supply and establishing China as a technological hub for sensing innovation. This enormous manufacturing capability has been important for rapidly cutting unit prices, in our view. The ASP of Hesai's LiDAR unit has declined substantially, from approximately US$12.7k in 2020 to around US$500-800 in 2024, representing a reduction of over 95% (Check Sera). In comparison with the rest of the globe (LiDAR ASP: approximately US$800-1000, according Yole Group), China dominates the market with its cost and volume leadership, in our view.
2)	Government support. The Chinese government has implemented a comprehensive set of policies to boost the local LiDAR sector. Key national initiatives, such as the ""New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2021-2035)"" and the 14th Five-Year Plan, expressly urge the use of LiDAR into smart vehicles and cross-industry collaboration. According to Frost & Sullivan (a business consulting firm in the US), the LiDAR market in China is predicted to develop at a CAGR of 103% between 2021 and 2030F (Fig x).
3)	Industry dividend. The ADAS market, particularly in China, is emerging as a growth engine for LiDAR applications. Fuelled by the Chinese customers’ preference for higher levels of autonomous driving and the fast-paced product cycle iteration, Chinese automakers, like BYD, Xiaomi and China EV trio, have aggressively deployed LiDAR as the core perception solution for ADAS vehicles. Thanks to the rapid penetration of ADAS in China, in 2024, over 1.6m units of domestic LiDARs have been installed in NEVs, with a 12% penetration rate for China’s NEV market, according to Yole Group (an International consulting company), far surpassing other regions.
5.3	Domestic suppliers dominate China’s LiDAR market   
Key players in China LiDAR market. Chinese suppliers control 92% of the global automotive LiDAR market in terms of value, with Hesai, RoboSense, and Huawei accounting for over 75% of sales in 2024, according to Yole Group (Fig X). Hesai Group (Hesai, HSAI US, Add, TP:US$???) : Dominating the global market leadership. Hesai has maintained its leadership in term of revenue in the automotive LiDAR market for the fourth consecutive year (2021 to 2024), according Yole Group. Its dominance is especially evident in the robotaxi sector, where it holds a commanding 61% market share in 2024, according to Yole Group. It also supplies industry leaders, such as Zoox, DiDi (DIDIY US, Not Rated), Pony AI (PONY US, Not Rated) and WeRide (WRD US, Not Rated), further consolidating its leading position in the AD LiDAR market.
Hesai’s story stems from its intelligent mass production and strategic partnership with tier-1 domestic automakers. As of the end of 2024, Hesai’s cumulative LiDAR shipments exceeded 500,000 units globally, more than double the c.222,000 units in 2023, thanks to deep collaborations with prominent automotive OEMs, such as Li Auto, NIO and Great Wall Motors. It has secured design wins with 22 OEMs across over 120 vehicle models in 2024, the company said.
Hesai’s global leadership is supported by its in-house ASIC chip development and highly automated intelligent production of scale, creating synergies and economies of scale for the company.
RoboSense (2489 HK, Add, TP: HK$??): Challenging the market leader. RoboSense emerged as a formidable competitor to Hesai, with a steady increase in its global market share from 22% in 2023 to 24% in 2024, according to Yole Group. With robust OEM partnerships across China and worldwide, it plays a vital role in expanding LiDAR deployment in ADAS applications, particularly in PV and robotaxis. In 2024, the company reported impressive sales growth, with a cumulative shipment of 519,800 units, underscoring its growing influence in the automotive LiDAR market.
Thanks to its pioneering innovation in proprietary MEMS chips and LiDAR production technology, RoboSense has established partnerships with over 30 OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers worldwide, including major automotive manufacturers such as BYD, Xpeng, Geely, and Xiaomi. RoboSense’s LiDAR technology leadership is commercially validated by its solid-state M Platform LiDAR products. Its EM-Platform LiDAR products, which combine Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) arrays and single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD)-SoC receivers and delivered at mass-market costs, have set industry benchmarks, in our view. In addition, RoboSense integrates AI perception software with its advanced LiDAR hardware, providing one-stop AI perception solutions, which differentiate its product mix from peers focusing on LiDAR hardware only.
Huawei Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance (HIMA, Unlisted): Rising market entrants posing threats. Huawei, a telecommunications giant, has rapidly expanded its footprint in the automotive LiDAR market, increasing its market share from 6% in 2023 to 19% in 2024. This rapid growth positions Huawei as the third largest player in the global automotive LiDAR market, intensifying the fierce market competition and threatening the duopoly of Hesai and RoboSense.
Huawei’s HIMA leverages its telecommunications expertise and semiconductor ecosystem to offer competitively economical solutions, in our view. This market penetration strategy has helped it rapidly seize market share and OEM partnerships. With technological strengths in ADAS LiDAR deployment, Huawei’s 96-line LiDAR and 4D millimeter-wave radars are increasingly adopted by many customers in the automotive sector.5.4	Critical safety enhancement features   
Beyond navigation assistance. LiDAR outperforms other perception solutions, like camera and radar, in term sof its enhanced safety features (Fig x). 5.5	Comparing mechanical LiDAR with solid-state LiDAR   
Mechanical LiDAR uses rotating parts for 360° scanning but suffers from high cost, fragility, and bulkiness. Solid-state LiDAR replaces moving components with pure electronic beam steering (e.g., optical phased arrays or flash illumination), enabling compact, durable designs. Meanwhile, semi-solid-state LiDAR (e.g., Microelectromechanical system micro-mirrors,) offers a middle ground—microscopic moving parts enable better field-of-view and resolution than pure solid-state, while remaining smaller and cheaper than mechanical systems.
The industry is rapidly shifting toward solid-state and semi-solid-state solutions for automotive ADAS, driven by reliability needs, falling costs (<Rmb500/unit by 2025), and seamless integration. While mechanical variants remain in niche applications (e.g., mapping), semi-solid-state Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) LiDAR currently dominates mass-market deployments, bridging performance gaps until pure solid-state matures (Fig x).

8573546f-8dbb-4602-a7f8-eae02923266d,"Give me 5 sentences as to why someone should read this report with key ideas:

FY25 was the worst year for our staples coverage in terms of EBITDA growth in over a decade, and the sector will have a favourable base as the year progresses. However, we are not too excited about the optical recovery prospects. In 1QFY26, we expect our staples coverage to see sales growth inch up, helped by inflationary price hikes, but EBITDA margin to be lower y-y for all staples companies. We expect our discretionary and consumer internet coverage to continue to see strong growth. Our preference for affluent consumption continues.

Consumer staples: expect a gradual recovery in sales and EBITDA growth
For our staples coverage, on aggregate we expect sales growth to improve to 7% y-y (ex-ITC) in 1QFY26 vs 5% in 4QFY25, boosted by price hikes taken to counter inflation and a slight recovery in demand. We also expect EBITDA growth to recover in 3-4% vs 0-1% in 2HFY25. We expect Marico and GCPL to outperform within staples. We expect broad-based margin pressure in 1QFY26 but with commodity costs having eased, we expect margin recovery in 2HFY26. Indian FMCG firms have seen broad-based earnings estimate cuts over the last one year, which their stock-price performance has reflected. Despite a slightly improved outlook, we see low valuation comfort in staples.

Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Internet: Strong growth set to continue
We find urban discretionary consumption well placed in FY26 due to lowering of the income-tax rate and interest rates, along with lower food inflation. In 1QFY26, Titan and Jubi have seen 18% y-y sales growth and are factoring in slight margin improvement leading to 20%+ EBITDA growth y-y.

We prefer affluent and discretionary consumption plays
We continue to find a disconnect between the FMCG growth prospects and valuations. Within FMCG, we like the relatively reasonably valued ITC and HUVR. We like Titan but find Jubi expensive and see the high capex and lack of FCF generation as concerns. In Consumer Internet, we like both Eternal and Swiggy for their strong growth and FCF generation prospects.",integrate_search,user,normal,Allie Eom,allie.eom@asia.bnpparibas.com,general,BNP Paribas,15142.0,2025-07-10 23:30:20+00:00,active,,2025-06-09,active,

2. Demand Outlook 2024-30
India’s paper demand is set to outpace global averages, driven by packaging, e-commerce, and regulatory substitution, with per-capita consumption still far below China.

Project 6–8% industry CAGR through 2030, with packaging paper/board at 8–13% CAGR, led by e-commerce and FMCG 1 2 10 27.
Per-capita paper consumption to rise from 16–19 kg to 28–30 kg by 2030, still <60% of global average and far below China 22 23 24.
Packaging now exceeds 60% of total demand; e-commerce packaging CAGR 26.7% (2024–30), corrugated boxes dominate with 67% share 10 67 27 31.
Writing/printing paper to grow 3–4% CAGR, with textbook/education offsetting office/copy decline; digital substitution risk persists 11 18.

Tissue and specialty papers are fastest-growing at 11–15% CAGR, driven by urban hygiene, QSR, and hotel demand 11 18.
Plastic ban is a structural catalyst: kraft paper market at 11.02 MMT , projected 7.2% CAGR to 21.3 MMT by 2033 67 64.
Demand elasticity to GDP remains high; every 1% GDP growth adds ~0.8% to paper demand 1 10.
Key swing factors: pace of plastic-ban enforcement, e-commerce penetration, and digital adoption in education/newsprint 64 11.
Table:
Segment	2023-24 Share	2024-30E CAGR	2030E Demand/Notes
Packaging Paper/Board	>60%	8–13%	E-com, FMCG, plastic ban
Writing & Printing	31–35%	3–4%	Textbook up, office copy down
Newsprint	~10%	-5 to -7%	Digital substitution, import drop
Tissue & Specialty	<5%	11–15%	Hygiene, QSR, urbanization
India’s demand trajectory is anchored by packaging and regulatory substitution, with per-capita catch-up and e-commerce as secular tailwinds 1 2 10 27 67 64 22 23 24 11 18 31.

2.1. Packaging Paper & Board
Packaging paper and board will drive Indian paper sector outperformance, with 11–13% volume CAGR anchored by e-commerce, FMCG, and regulatory substitution.

Packaging now exceeds 60% of total paper demand; segment CAGR is 8–13% through 2030, outpacing global averages 1 10 27.
Containerboard and cartonboard are the core growth engines, with containerboard demand tightly linked to corrugated box expansion for e-commerce and retail 27 31.
India’s corrugated boxes market is valued at $7.8B , projected to reach $18.6B by 2033 (9.6% CAGR); broader corrugated packaging at $25B , rising to $47.5B by 2035 (6% CAGR) 27 28.
E-commerce packaging is the fastest-growing sub-segment, with a 26.7% CAGR (2024–30); corrugated boxes account for 67% of e-commerce packaging by value 31 29 30.
End-use mix is shifting: food and beverage remain the largest, but e-commerce, fashion, and electronics are the fastest-growing verticals 31 27.
The single-use plastic ban is a structural catalyst, driving kraft paper demand; kraft market at 11.02 MMT , projected 7.2% CAGR to 21.3 MMT by 2033 67 64.
Despite demand surge, FY24 saw oversupply and price volatility due to raw material constraints and fiber import disruptions 71 68.
Imports remain a swing factor: 1.9 MMT of paper/board imported in FY24, with ASEAN/China supply pressuring domestic prices 39 7.
Regulatory substitution and consumer sustainability preferences are accelerating the shift to paper-based packaging, supporting long-term volume and margin resilience 64 67.
Table:
Metric/Segment	2024 Value	2030/33/35E Value	CAGR (%)	Notes/Drivers
Corrugated Boxes Market	$7.8B	$18.6B	9.6 (25–33)	E-com, retail, food
Corrugated Packaging Market	$25.0B	$47.5B	6.0 (25–35)	Broader packaging
E-Com Packaging Market	n/a	$15.8B	26.7 (24–30)	Corrugated boxes 67% share
Kraft Paper Market	11.02 MMT	21.3 MMT	7.2 (24–33)	Plastic ban, regulatory substitution
Packaging paper and board are set for secular growth, with e-commerce and policy tailwinds offsetting near-term supply volatility 1 10 27 31 67 64 71 68 39 7.

2.2. Writing & Printing
Writing and printing paper demand will grow at a muted 3–4% CAGR through 2030, with textbook and education-driven volumes offsetting structural office and copy paper decline.

Segment share is 31–35% of total Indian paper demand, but growth lags packaging due to digital substitution and stagnant office use 11 18.
Textbook and educational material demand remains resilient, underpinned by rising school enrollments, government education spend, and the New Education Policy rollout; textbook volumes are stable to up modestly YoY 18 18.
Office/copy paper faces secular headwinds: remote work, digital workflows, and e-governance initiatives are driving a persistent decline in commercial and institutional consumption 11.
Digital substitution risk is material: every 1% increase in digital adoption in education or government can shave 0.5–1% off segment growth, with newsprint and office grades most exposed 11.
Enrollment growth and textbook replacement cycles provide a floor, but upside is capped by rapid digitization and policy pushes for e-content 18.
Imports of uncoated writing and printing paper surged 214% in FY23, mainly from ASEAN/China, pressuring domestic pricing and utilization 39.
Margin pressure persists: input cost inflation , import competition, and limited pricing power constrain EBITDA expansion for pure-play writing/printing mills 11 39.
Key swing factors: pace of digital classroom adoption, government textbook procurement cycles, and further import duty changes.
Table:

Driver/Metric	2023-24 Value	2024-30E CAGR	Notes/Outlook
Segment Share of Demand	31–35%	3–4%	Textbook up, office copy down
Textbook/Education Volumes	Stable/up	3–5%	Enrollment, NEP, state orders
Office/Copy Paper	Down	-2 to 0%	Digital, remote work, e-gov
Import Growth	+214%	n/a	ASEAN/China supply, price pressure
Digital Substitution Risk	High	n/a	0.5–1% CAGR drag per 1% digital up
Writing and printing paper is a structurally challenged segment, with textbook demand providing a floor but digital substitution and import pressure capping upside 11 18 39.

2.3. Newsprint
Newsprint demand in India is in structural decline, falling 5–7% annually as digital media accelerates share loss and import reliance erodes.

Newsprint now accounts for ~10% of total Indian paper demand, down from historical highs, with the segment shrinking at a 5–7% CAGR through 2030 11.
Digital substitution is the primary headwind: print newspaper circulation and advertising volumes continue to contract as online news, mobile, and OTT platforms gain share, especially in urban and English-language markets 11.
Domestic production is underutilized; many mills have shifted capacity to packaging or specialty grades to offset newsprint weakness 11.
Imports, historically >50% of Indian newsprint supply, have dropped sharply as demand contracts and the INR depreciates, raising landed costs and narrowing the arbitrage versus domestic supply 11.
FY23 saw a further erosion in import share, with newsprint classified as “Restricted” for imports, requiring special permissions and limiting volume flexibility 39 40.
Price trends remain soft: global newsprint prices have stabilized after pandemic-driven volatility, but Indian domestic prices are capped by weak demand and import parity, with no material pricing power for producers 11.
INR depreciation provides a partial hedge for domestic mills, as higher import costs support local realizations, but this is offset by volume attrition and fixed-cost deleverage 11.
Key swing factors: pace of digital adoption in regional markets, further INR moves, and any regulatory changes to import policy or newsprint duties.
Table:

Metric/Driver	2023-24 Value	2024-30E CAGR	Notes/Outlook
Segment Share of Demand	~10%	-5 to -7%	Digital substitution, import drop
Import Share	<50%	Down	INR depreciation, import restrictions
Domestic Price Trend	Flat/soft	n/a	Weak demand, import parity
INR Hedge Effect	Partial	n/a	Higher import cost supports local
Newsprint is a structurally challenged segment with no cyclical recovery in sight; digital migration and import headwinds will continue to pressure volumes and margins 11 39 40.

2.4. Tissue & Specialty
Tissue and specialty papers are the fastest-growing segment in the Indian paper industry, posting 11–15% CAGR through 2030, outpacing all other grades 11 18.

Urbanization, rising hygiene awareness, and penetration of organized retail are driving tissue demand, with per-capita consumption still well below global averages, signaling long runway for growth 11.
The COVID-19 pandemic structurally accelerated demand for tissue products—facial tissue, napkins, kitchen towels, and medical-grade papers—across urban households, hospitals, and institutional buyers 11.
Quick-service restaurants , hotels, and the expanding foodservice sector are key volume drivers; tissue and specialty grades are tightly correlated with the pace of urban consumption and hospitality capex 11 18.
Total addressable market for tissue and specialty is still <5% of Indian paper demand, but segment share is rising rapidly as hygiene spend per capita increases and new product categories (e.g., wet wipes, medical disposables) gain traction 11.
Specialty papers—including décor, filter, food-grade, and technical papers—are benefiting from regulatory tailwinds and import substitution, with domestic producers ramping up capacity and product innovation 18.
Margin profile is attractive: tissue and specialty grades command premium pricing, face less import pressure than commoditized grades, and offer higher EBITDA per tonne for integrated players with scale and distribution 11.
Key swing factors: pace of urbanization, QSR/hospitality expansion, regulatory enforcement on food and medical packaging, and ability of domestic players to scale up quality and branding.
Table:
Segment	2023-24 Share	2024-30E CAGR	TAM/Notes
Tissue & Specialty	<5%	11–15%	Hygiene, QSR, medical, specialty
Tissue and specialty are the secular growth engines of the Indian paper sector, with premiumization, urban hygiene, and regulatory substitution driving sustained outperformance 11 18.

India’s paper industry operates 27 MMT of installed capacity , with utilization rates in the 85–90% range for leading integrated players, but sector-wide utilization is diluted by subscale and idle mills 1 2 12. The top 10 producers—led by ITC, JK Paper, West Coast, and Tamil Nadu Newsprint—control the bulk of high-efficiency, low-cost capacity, while the long tail of 850–900 mills remains fragmented and structurally disadvantaged 1 10 12.

JK Paper is executing a major brownfield/greenfield expansion, raising capacity from 450,000 TPA to 800,000 TPA by FY26, with INR 2,100 crore capex (INR 60,000/tonne) 33 34. TNPL is adding a 36,500 TPA tissue line (INR 600–650 crore capex; INR 164,000–178,000/tonne) 35 36. The sector’s capex queue totals ~2.5 MMT through 2027, with most new tonnage targeting packaging, tissue, and specialty grades.
Cost curve leadership is concentrated: JK Paper, ITC-PSPD, and West Coast operate in the lowest quartile of domestic cash costs, leveraging scale, captive fiber, and energy integration. TNPL and Andhra Paper are competitive in specialty and tissue, but smaller mills face persistent margin compression from input volatility and import arbitrage 1 12.
Import pressure is acute: FY24 paper and board imports surged 68% in two years to 1.93 MMT, driven by zero-duty ASEAN/China supply and INR depreciation 7 39. Imports are concentrated in newsprint, kraftliner, and uncoated writing/printing grades, with import duties and “Restricted” status for newsprint and select writing/printing only partially effective at curbing inflows 39 40.
Domestic cost curve is under pressure from global pulp/coal volatility and rising logistics costs. Mills with captive plantations and integrated power retain margin resilience, while those reliant on imported fiber or merchant coal face conversion cost inflation of INR 3–5/kg finished paper 62 61.
Utilization rates for top players remain robust (85–90%), but sector-wide rates are diluted by the long tail of subscale, underinvested mills—many of which are at risk of closure or consolidation as environmental and compliance capex rises 1 12.
Capex discipline is evident: brownfield expansions dominate, with IRR targets >15% and payback periods <5 years for integrated projects. M&A activity is selective, focused on distressed asset roll-ups and specialty/niche capacity 33 35.
Import duties and regulatory barriers remain a swing factor: any further reduction in duties or relaxation of “Restricted” status could trigger another import wave, pressuring domestic utilization and pricing 39 40.
Table: Top Indian Paper Producers – Capacity, Capex, and Cost Position

India’s supply landscape is consolidating around scale, integration, and regulatory compliance. The next 2–3 years will see capacity additions skewed to packaging and tissue, with cost curve leadership and import discipline as the key margin swing factors 1 10 33 35 39 7 12 62 61 40.

3.1. Current Capacity by Producer
Top Indian paper producers cluster in the lowest quartile of the domestic cost curve, with integrated scale, captive fiber, and energy driving utilization and margin resilience.

ITC-PSPD, JK Paper, and West Coast Paper Mills anchor the high-efficiency end, each operating >85% utilization on capacities of ~800,000 TPA , 450,000–800,000 TPA (JK, post-expansion), and ~570,000 TPA 1 12 17.
JK Paper’s brownfield/greenfield ramp is the largest ongoing addition, with INR 2,100 crore capex at INR 60,000/tonne—well below new-build global benchmarks 33 34.
TNPL is adding 36,500 TPA of tissue (INR 600–650 crore; INR 164,000–178,000/tonne), targeting specialty margin pools; Satia and N R Agarwal focus on education, duplex, and writing/printing, but operate at mid-curve cost positions 35 36 18 12.
Utilization for top quartile players remains robust (85–90%), supported by captive plantations, integrated power, and strong distribution; sector-wide rates are diluted by subscale, underinvested mills, many of which are at risk of closure or consolidation 1 12.
Cost curve leadership is decisive: integrated players with captive fiber and energy consistently deliver 200–400 bps higher EBITDA margins than mid-curve or merchant mills, especially during pulp/coal volatility 1 12 17.
Table:
Company	FY24 Capacity	Capex Pipeline	Capex/tonne	Cost Curve Position	Utilization (%)	Notes
ITC-PSPD	~800,000	n/a	n/a	Lowest quartile	90	Integrated, VAP leader
JK Paper	450,000 → 800,000	350,000	60,000	Lowest quartile	85–90	Brownfield/greenfield

Lowest-quartile cost players are best positioned to defend margins and gain share as compliance capex and input volatility force further sector consolidation 1 12 17 33 34 35 36 18.
3.2. Capex & M&A Tracker
JK Paper leads the current capex cycle, executing a brownfield/greenfield expansion from 450,000 TPA to 800,000 TPA by FY26, with INR 2,100 crore committed (INR 60,000/tonne)—well below global new-build benchmarks and targeting IRRs >15% 33 34. TNPL is deploying INR 600–650 crore for a 36,500 TPA tissue line (INR 164,000–178,000/tonne), focused on specialty margin pools and power infrastructure upgrades 35 36. Sector-wide, the capex pipeline totals ~2.5 MMT through 2027, with most new tonnage skewed to packaging, tissue, and specialty grades.

Funding is predominantly internal accruals and low-cost debt, with top players maintaining net-debt/EBITDA below 2x, preserving balance sheet flexibility for opportunistic M&A 33 12. Brownfield expansions dominate, reflecting capex discipline and sub-5-year paybacks for integrated projects.

M&A activity remains selective: consolidation is focused on distressed asset roll-ups and specialty/niche capacity, as subscale mills struggle with compliance capex and input volatility. No transformational deals have closed in the last 12 months, but sector fragmentation and rising environmental standards set the stage for further consolidation among mid-curve and non-integrated players 12 1.

Key catalysts: commissioning of JK Paper’s new capacity , TNPL’s tissue ramp (FY25–26), and any regulatory shifts on import duties or environmental compliance. Watch for opportunistic acquisitions as smaller mills capitulate under cost and compliance pressure, with integrated leaders best positioned to gain share and margin 33 12 1 35 36.

3.3. Import/Export Balance
India’s paper and paperboard imports surged 68% in two years, reaching 1.93 MMT in FY24, driven by zero-duty ASEAN/China supply and INR depreciation 7 39. Imports are concentrated in newsprint , kraftliner, and uncoated writing/printing grades , with newsprint and select writing/printing sub-categories now classified as “Restricted” for imports, requiring special permissions and limiting volume flexibility 39 40.

FY23 aggregate import value was INR 12,531 crore, with uncoated writing/printing paper imports up 214% YoY, led by Indonesia, Singapore, and China 39.
Total paper and board imports rose 25% in FY23 over FY22; newsprint import data is not separately disclosed but is structurally declining as digital substitution accelerates 39.
Export value for Indian paper and paperboard products reached $3.04B in 2023, with niche strengths in specialty, value-added packaging, and select writing/printing grades 12.
Import duties and regulatory barriers remain a swing factor: any further reduction in duties or relaxation of “Restricted” status could trigger another import wave, pressuring domestic utilization and pricing 39 40.
The import mix is shifting: ASEAN/China supply dominates low-cost grades, while domestic players defend share in value-added and specialty segments.
INR depreciation partially offsets import volume pressure by raising landed costs, but also narrows the arbitrage for domestic producers, especially in commoditized grades 7.
Export growth is capped by global overcapacity and price competition, but Indian producers are gaining share in Middle East, Africa, and select APAC markets for packaging and specialty papers 12.
Table: India Paper & Board Import/Export Snapshot (FY23–24)

Metric/HS Code	FY23 Value/Volume	FY24 Value/Volume	YoY Change	Notes/Drivers
Total Imports (excl. 4801)	INR 12,531 crore	n/a	+25%	ASEAN/China, INR depreciation
Imports (all paper/board)	1.145 MMT	1.93 MMT	+68%	Zero-duty, import surge
Uncoated W&P	n/a	n/a	+214%	Indonesia, Singapore, China
Newsprint	n/a	n/a	Declining	“Restricted” import status
Exports	$3.04B	n/a	n/a	Packaging, specialty, W&P
India’s import/export balance is a key margin swing factor: import surges pressure domestic utilization and pricing, while export upside is limited to niche, value-added segments. Regulatory discipline on duties and “Restricted” status will determine the sector’s ability to defend share and margin as global overcapacity persists 7 39 40 12.

3.4. Cost Curve Positioning
India’s domestic paper cost curve is bifurcated: integrated majors (ITC-PSPD, JK Paper, West Coast) anchor the lowest quartile, while subscale mills cluster mid-to-high curve, exposed to input and compliance shocks.

Integrated leaders achieve FOB cash costs 15–25% below sector average, leveraging captive fiber (eucalyptus at Rs 230–260/quintal), in-house power, and scale logistics 51 17 12.
Brownfield capex (JK: Rs 60,000/tonne) is 40–60% cheaper than new-build ASEAN/China, supporting IRRs >15% and rapid payback 33 34.
Mills reliant on imported fiber or merchant coal face conversion cost inflation: coal procurement up to Rs 10,500–11,000/tonne , with Rs 3–5/kg added to finished paper costs; imported coal FOB at $155/tonne, up 5x from prior years 62 61.
Freight and surcharges (e.g., Rs 300/tonne NCL levy) further widen the cost gap, especially for non-integrated players distant from coal/fiber sources 59 60.
INR depreciation narrows import arbitrage: as the rupee weakens, landed cost of ASEAN/China supply rises, partially insulating domestic mid-curve players but compressing margins for those with USD-linked pulp/coal exposure 7 43.
ASEAN/China cost leaders still undercut Indian mid-curve mills on commoditized grades, but lowest-quartile Indian players remain competitive in value-added packaging and specialty 7 39.
Margin resilience is concentrated: ITC, JK, and West Coast consistently deliver 200–400 bps higher EBITDA margins than sector average, even during pulp/coal volatility 15 16 17.
Cost curve pressure is structural: as compliance capex rises, subscale and non-integrated mills face existential margin squeeze, accelerating sector consolidation 1 12.
Table: Illustrative Domestic Paper Cost Curve (2024, Rs/tonne FOB)

Player/Segment	Cash Cost (Rs/t)	Margin Position	Notes
ITC-PSPD, JK, West Coast	35,000–40,000	Lowest quartile	Captive fiber/power, scale, integration
TNPL, Andhra, Satia	45,000–55,000	Mid-curve	Specialty, partial integration
Subscale/merchant mills	55,000–65,000+	High-curve	Import/coal reliant, compliance drag
ASEAN/China imports	38,000–45,000*	Competitive	Zero-duty, FX sensitive
*Converted at prevailing INR/USD; actual landed cost varies with FX, freight, and duties.

Margin leadership will remain with integrated, scale players as input volatility and regulatory costs force further rationalization of India’s fragmented cost curve 1 12 17 33 59 62 61 7 43 39.

4. Raw Material & Energy Economics
Raw material and energy costs are the decisive margin swing factors for Indian paper producers, with fiber and energy accounting for two-thirds of COGS.

COGS breakdown for integrated mills: fiber 45%, energy 20%, chemicals 8%, with the remainder split across labor, logistics, and overheads 1 51 62.
Fiber cost volatility is structural: eucalyptus (farm-gate Rs 230–260/quintal in 2024) remains the anchor for integrated players, while imported waste paper and pulp expose mid-curve mills to global price swings and FX risk 51 17 12.
Energy inflation is acute: coal procurement for paper mills surged to Rs 10,500–11,000/tonne in 2024 (from Rs 5,000–6,500/tonne), with a new Rs 300/tonne NCL levy and 55% of Coal India’s supply moving by rail, amplifying delivered cost for non-integrated players 62 61 59 60.
Conversion cost inflation: every Rs 1,000/tonne increase in coal or fiber adds Rs 1–2/kg to finished paper costs, with large/medium mills using 800–900 kg coal per tonne of paper and small mills 300–400 kg 62 61.
Imported coal (FOB $155/tonne, up 5x from prior years) and global pulp (NBSK >$1,000/tonne in 2024) drive pass-through risk for non-integrated and merchant mills, compressing margins during commodity spikes 43 62.
Freight and logistics are non-trivial: regional cost differentials widen as rail and shipping costs rise, with delivered cost gaps of Rs 2,000–4,000/tonne between integrated and non-integrated players 59 60.
Price pass-through is partial: integrated majors defend 200–400 bps higher EBITDA margins via captive fiber/power, while mid-curve and merchant mills face margin squeeze and are forced to pass on only a fraction of input inflation to end-customers 15 16 17 62.
Regulatory and compliance costs are rising, further pressuring subscale mills and accelerating sector consolidation as only scale players can absorb the capex and input shocks 1 12.
Table: COGS and Input Cost Benchmarks

Input Component	Share of COGS (%)	2024 Benchmark Cost	Notes/Drivers
Fiber (wood/pulp)	45	Rs 230–260/quintal	Eucalyptus, waste paper, imports
Energy (coal/power)	20	Rs 10,500–11,000/tonne	Coal India, imported coal, surcharges
Chemicals	8	n/a	Sizing, bleaching, specialty
Logistics/Freight	5–10	Rs 2,000–4,000/tonne diff.	Rail, shipping, regional spread
Labor/Other	17–22	n/a	Overhead, compliance, maintenance
Margin resilience is concentrated among integrated, scale players with captive fiber and energy. Input volatility and regulatory costs will continue to force rationalization of India’s fragmented cost curve 1 51 62 61 59 60 43 15 16 17 12.

4.1. Wood Fibre Availability
Integrated Indian paper producers secure margin resilience through captive eucalyptus plantations, with farm-gate prices and yield trends favoring scale players.

Eucalyptus is the dominant pulpwood, with 2024 farm-gate prices at Rs 230–260 per quintal for bulk transactions to local middlemen; mandi/wholesale prices can reach Rs 600–700 per quintal, but these are not realized by growers 51 52 53.
Improved clonal plantations yield 300–400 kg per tree over a 4–5 year cycle; typical block plantations achieve 300–600 tonnes per hectare, with 1,000–1,500 trees per hectare 54 53.
Major producers run extensive farm-forestry programs, distributing free saplings, providing technical support, and offering buy-back guarantees to farmers—ensuring fiber security and cost control 17 56.
India has ~4 million hectares under eucalyptus, ~10% of global plantations, supporting both industry and rural incomes 55.
Yield and price volatility are regionally driven: North Indian prices benchmark to Yamunanagar mandi, while southern clusters benefit from proximity to integrated mills and established supply chains 51 17.
Fiber security scoring: ITC, JK Paper, and West Coast lead on captive sourcing, with >70% of fiber from own or contracted plantations, minimizing exposure to spot market swings; mid-curve and subscale mills rely more on open-market wood and imported waste paper, increasing margin risk 17 12.
Ongoing R&D in high-yield, disease-resistant clones is raising per-hectare productivity and reducing rotation cycles, further lowering delivered fiber cost for integrated players 56 54.
Sustainability: Corporate forestry programs are critical for long-term supply, regulatory compliance, and ESG positioning, with leading mills reporting >90% of wood from sustainable sources 17 56.
Table:
Metric	Value/Range	Notes/Context
Farm-gate price (Rs/quintal)	230–260	Bulk, standing crop
Mandi/wholesale price (Rs/q)	600–700	Not realized by farmers
Yield per tree	300–400	4–5 year cycle, improved clones
Yield per hectare	300–600 (4–5 yrs)	1,000–1,500 trees/ha
Plantation area	~4 million	10% of global eucalyptus
Captive fiber share	>70%	ITC, JK, West Coast
Integrated majors with captive fiber and robust farm-forestry programs are best positioned to defend margins and supply security as input volatility and regulatory scrutiny rise 51 52 53 54 55 17 56 12.

4.2. Recovered Paper Market
India’s recovered paper market is structurally constrained by a low domestic collection rate—just 35% versus China’s 60%—forcing heavy reliance on imports to meet packaging and board demand 1 2. This gap is a critical margin swing factor for non-integrated and mid-curve mills.

Domestic collection infrastructure remains fragmented and informal, with most urban and industrial centers lacking organized recovery and sorting. As a result, only about one-third of used paper is recycled domestically, compared to China’s state-driven 60%+ recovery rate 1 2.
India operates a zero-duty regime on waste paper imports, making it one of the world’s largest importers of recovered fiber. Imported waste paper is a primary input for packaging grades, especially kraftliner and duplex board, and is essential for mills without captive wood or integrated pulping .
Price volatility is acute: global waste paper prices are highly sensitive to shipping costs, supply chain disruptions, and policy changes in major exporting countries (e.g., US, Europe, Middle East). Indian mills saw input cost spikes in 2022–24 as freight rates surged and global supply tightened, compressing margins and triggering finished paper price hikes 61 62.
Policy risk is non-trivial. While India’s zero-duty import policy supports supply security, any move to restrict imports or impose duties (as seen in China’s 2017–20 waste import ban) would sharply raise input costs and threaten mill viability, especially for non-integrated players 68.
The sector faces a structural supply/demand mismatch: packaging paper demand is growing at 8–13% CAGR, but domestic recovered fiber supply is flat to modestly up, making India increasingly exposed to global waste paper market cycles 1 10 68.
Quality and contamination remain persistent issues. Imported waste paper often arrives with higher moisture and non-paper content, raising processing costs and yield losses for Indian mills compared to domestic or high-grade international supply .
Regulatory and ESG scrutiny is rising. As India’s packaging sector grows, pressure is mounting for improved domestic collection, formalization of the recycling chain, and traceability to meet both environmental standards and customer requirements 10 68.
Key swing factors: any tightening of import policy, global freight or supply shocks, and the pace of domestic collection reform. Mills with diversified fiber sourcing and strong supplier relationships are best positioned to defend margins through volatility.
Table: Recovered Paper Market Benchmarks

Metric	India	China	Notes/Implications
Collection Rate (%)	35	60	Structural supply gap
Import Duty	0%	Ban (post-20)	India exposed to global cycles
Price Volatility	High	Moderate	Freight, policy, supply shocks
Policy Risk	Rising	High	Import regime, ESG, traceability
India’s recovered paper market is a structural bottleneck for the sector: low collection, high import reliance, and policy risk will continue to drive input volatility and margin dispersion across the cost curve 1 2 61 62 68 10.

4.3. Pulp Price Outlook
FOEX NBSK pulp prices surged in 2024, driving margin volatility and exposing Indian producers to global supply shocks and FX risk.

NBSK pulp started 2024 at $600–$725/tonne , rebounded to $807–$880/tonne in Q2, and spiked to $1,040/tonne and $1,600+/tonne by mid-year, before softening to $767/tonne in Q4 41 42 43 44 45 46 47.

The price rally was triggered by global supply disruptions—Finland strikes, Canadian mill shutdowns—tightening inventories and amplifying regional price differentials (Europe >$1,500/tonne vs China $1,040/tonne in April) 46.

Indian integrated players with captive fiber absorbed pulp inflation, but mid-curve and merchant mills saw EBITDA compression of 300–500 bps as pulp costs rose 20–40% YoY 43 62.

USD-INR sensitivity is acute: every 1% INR depreciation adds ~Rs 400/tonne to imported pulp cost, narrowing arbitrage for domestic producers and raising landed cost for import-reliant mills 7 43.

Scenario: a +/-10% move in global pulp prices shifts sector EBITDA margins by 120–180 bps for non-integrated players; integrated majors defend margins via captive fiber and pass-through pricing 43 15 16 17.

Pulp price volatility remains the key margin swing factor: a sustained NBSK >$1,000/tonne or INR >85/USD would force further price hikes or trigger margin compression for mid-curve mills 43 62.

Watch for further supply shocks, China demand inflections, and INR moves as catalysts for the next margin reset.

8ac7275b-1818-46f3-9fd2-da75a43f0e58,"Analyse these paragraphs on Terra USD. If arbitrage is used why do they need to burn coins? ""1. UST was pegged to LUNA
UST and Luna start with a link. In this case, one UST token would always be worth $1 USD of Luna and can be freely exchanged whenever you want. Whenever you exchange one for the other, smart contracts reduce the amount outstanding of the token that you are selling and increase the amount outstanding of the token that you are buying.  

Using a numerical example, let’s start with a system of 100 UST. We also start with 20 Luna tokens. So, in this case, since one UST would always be worth $1 USD of Luna, you could sell 1 UST and redeem it for 1/5 of a Luna token. Hence, 1 whole Luna token would be worth $5.

If the price of UST falls below $1, say 90 cents, traders would buy 1 UST for less than a dollar and swap that for $1 worth of Luna tokens and sell that for $1 and lock in an instant profit of 10 cents. The smart contract would automatically reduce the amount of UST outstanding by one token and increase the amount of Luna tokens by 1/5 of a token. Traders would continue this arbitrage process until enough USTs have been taken out of circulation by the software to raise the price back to $1.

On the other hand, if UST rises above $1, say $1.10 a token, there is an incentive for traders to buy $1 worth of Luna tokens and exchange that token for 1 UST and sell the UST for $1.10 to lock in a profit of 10 cents. Again, smart contracts would do the opposite of the last example and would increase the amount of UST outstanding by one token and decrease the amount of Luna outstanding this time. Only when enough USTs have been added to circulation to bring the price of UST back to $1 would the swapping stop.""",integrate_search,user,normal,Ian Hui,intern9@carretprivate.com,general,Carret Private,,2025-07-18 06:43:49+00:00,active,,2025-06-18,,

8dfbc555-90ca-4d4a-b4f4-4bee0ae25cb0,"make that data like this template of wording: Red and white cooperative regulation details
■ On 23 Jul, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) released regulations and details for
the Red and White Cooperative government programme.
■ Operational details (e.g., scheme of subsidy) for SOE banks are yet to be
released; loans will be up to Rp3bn with an interest rate of 6%.
Background on the red and white village cooperative programme
● The Red and White Cooperative (PMK No. 49 of 2025) programme was launched on 21
Jul 2025 with an aim to increase welfare for villagers nationwide.
● Notably, the government is targeting 80,000 cooperatives. Currently, 108 village
cooperatives are undergoing the pilot phase.
Terms of loans to village cooperatives
● The government expects SOE banks to participate in the programme by providing loans
to cooperatives, although our channel checks with the banks indicate that they have not
yet started disbursing loans under the programme as they await further clarifications.
● The maximum loan size to a single cooperative is Rp3bn (including a maximum of
Rp500m for operational expenditure), with an interest rate of 6% and a loan tenor of up
to six years. Instalments will be due on the 12th of each month.
● The loans are intended to finance cooperative operations, procurement of nine
necessities, savings and loan activities, clinics, pharmacies, warehousing (including cold
storage), and/or logistics.
Loan approval process
● Heads of village cooperatives will submit loan proposals to SOE banks with the approval
of village heads or regent/mayor. Loan proposals must be accompanied by approved
business plans.
● Banks will conduct an assessment based on their underwriting standards and must
consider the following: loan ceiling for operational expenditure and the amount of
allocated village funds received by each village in the last three years.
● After approval, banks must send the loan agreements to the Minister (via the provided
application) no later than 14 working days after the loan agreements are signed.
● Local government officials must authorise the placement of village funds into a loan
repayment account when signing the loan agreements.
● Loan disbursements will be made to the village cooperative accounts; for operational
expenditure, funds will be transferred directly to vendors based on billing documents.
Procedures for lack of funds to repay loans
● If the available amount is insufficient to cover the loan principal and interest, banks may
submit a request letter for fund placement from the village fund budget.
● The placement of funds from the village fund budget must be transferred to the loan
repayment account no later than the last working day of the month in which the loan is
due. For municipal or village governments, this amount will be recorded as a receivable.
Additionally, assets purchased with the loans will serve as collateral for fund placement.
● Overall, we are still awaiting final operational details for SOE banks, especially whether
there will be funding support to disburse loans (or interest rate subsidy, if any). As village
funds will be used in case of loan default, we believe loans are less likely to be insured—
unlike the government subsidised micro loans (KUR). Hence, the Red and White
Cooperative will rely on the execution of village fund placement to mitigate credit risks,
which will affect the profitability of this programme, in our view. Additionally, we are also
awaiting the budget for this programme to meet this year’s disbursement target.
● Reiterate Overweight as we see the sector as a key beneficiary of potential net foreign
inflows and geopolitical stability; BBCA and BTPS are our top picks as we expect these
two banks to post in-line results for 2Q25F. Sector re-rating catalysts include an
acceleration in fiscal spending. Downside risks include worsening loan quality and
continued pressure on NIMs",rms,user,normal,Jason Chandra,jason.chandra@cgsi.com,general,CGS International,,2025-08-14 02:41:52+00:00,active,,2025-06-10,onboarded,onboarded

a3f2de4b-0c99-4c29-93dd-002b4e86b98c,"I am writing a sector analysis for the Automotive Parts sector, particularly investigating in the ADAS component sectors such as LiDAR, can you please help me write a paragraph, summarizing below's information?

In 2024, China’s automotive LiDAR market remains dominantly led by Hesai Technology, which holds the largest global market share at approximately 33% by sales revenue, marking its fourth consecutive year as the industry leader despite a slight decline from 38% in 2023. Close behind, RoboSense commands a 24% market share, showing steady growth and securing numerous design wins with key Chinese OEMs such as Xpeng and NIO. Huawei, rapidly expanding its footprint, surged to 19% market share, emerging as the clear third player and strengthening its position through aggressive pricing and integrated solutions. Collectively, these three Chinese suppliers control over 76%65% of the global LiDAR sales, underscoring China's dominance in the sector driven by robust government backing, scale manufacturing, and expansive partnerships with leading Chinese EV makers including Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, Changan, Xiaomi, and BYD.
Hesai’s leadership is supported by its in-house ASIC chip development, proprietary factories, and high automation enabling mass production at scale, which drives continual cost optimization and superior product performance. The company’s installed base exceeds 500,000 units globally, largely fueled by deep, strategic collaborations with prominent domestic OEMs like Li Auto, resulting in over 100 design wins. RoboSense also benefits from strong OEM relationships across China and worldwide, playing a pivotal role in expanding LiDAR adoption, especially for passenger cars and robotaxis. Huawei leverages its extensive telecommunications and semiconductor ecosystem to deliver cost-effective, high-quality solutions, rapidly winning market share and OEM partnerships. Overall, Chinese LiDAR suppliers have captured 93% of the 2024 market, benefiting from coordinated industrial policy, accelerated product cycles, and aggressive market penetration strategies, positioning them well ahead of Western rivals such as Valeo and Innoviz.


2.3 Key players
The Chinese approach to LiDAR integration contrasts notably with some Western manufacturers, particularly Tesla, which has rejected LiDAR in favor of camera-based systems. Chinese OEMs have embraced hybrid sensor solutions that include LiDAR alongside cameras and radar, creating more robust sensing systems.

Competitive Landscape
The global LiDAR market for automotive applications has become predominantly Chinese, with domestic suppliers capturing near total control of the global market share as of 2024 53. This dominance is closely linked to Chinese automakers' large-scale deployment and reliance on domestic supply chains. Three major Chinese companies- Hesai, RoboSense, and Huawei- have emerged as the leaders in this space, each with distinct market positioning and competitive advantages.

Hesai: Market Leader with Global Ambitions
Market Position and Performance
Hesai's dominance is particularly pronounced in the robotaxi segment, where it commands a 61% market share, supplying industry leaders such as Zoox, Aurora, Apollo, Didi, Pony, and WeRide 55. This represents a slight decline from its 74% share in this segment a year earlier52, but still demonstrates the company's strong position in high-end autonomous vehicle applications.
Figure 4
 
Hesai Group has established itself as the dominant player in the global automotive LiDAR market, maintaining the top position for four consecutive years 54. Hesai captured 33% of the global market by revenue in 2024 55. However, this represents a gradual decline from its 46% share in 2022 and 38% share in 2023 52, reflecting increasing competition in the market.
Strategic Partnerships and Manufacturing Scale
Hesai's story stems from its scalability, vertical integration, and strategic partnerships with global automakers. The company has secured design wins with 22 OEMs across over 120 vehicle models 56. Its ability to mass-produce high-quality LiDAR units at competitive prices has been central to its market leadership.
In 2024, Hesai achieved record shipments of approximately 501,900 LiDAR units, more than doubling from 222,100 units in 2023 57. This production scale reinforces the company's ability to meet growing demand while maintaining quality and cost advantages.
RoboSense: Challenging the Market Leader
Market Position and Performance
RoboSense has emerged as a strong challenger to Hesai's market leadership, steadily increasing its global market share from 22% in 2023 to 24% in 2024 52. The company has demonstrated impressive sales growth, with reported shipments of 519,800 units in 2024, making it the global annual sales leader53. This achievement underscores RoboSense's growing influence in the automotive LiDAR space.
Strategic Partnerships and Product Development
RoboSense has established partnerships with over 30 OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers worldwide, including major automotive manufacturers such as BYD, Zeekr, and IM53. One of its most notable collaborations is with XPeng for the G9 SUV, which is equipped with dual RoboSense second-generation smart solid-state LiDARs (RS-LiDAR-M1)58.
The XPeng implementation showcases the advantages of RoboSense's LiDAR technology, with two units deployed under the headlights on both sides of the vehicle, covering 180° horizontal view.
Funding and Expansion
RoboSense has attracted significant investor interest throughout its development. In 2017, the company received a combined investment of over $45 million, which was described as the largest-ever single round of financing for a Chinese LiDAR company at that time 59.
Huawei: The Rising Challenger
Market Entry and Rapid Growth
Telecommunications giant Huawei has made a dramatic entry into the automotive LiDAR market, increasing its market share from just 6% in 2023 to 19% in 2024 33. This rapid growth positions Huawei as the third-largest player in the global automotive LiDAR market, challenging the established duopoly of Hesai and RoboSense.
Strategic Automotive Partnerships
Huawei has forged strategic partnerships with several Chinese automakers, most notably with Seres to create the AITO brand of premium electric vehicles. The recent launch of the M5 Ultra SUV showcases Huawei's advanced driver assistance technology, including its 192-channel LiDAR and 4D millimeter-wave radars 60.

Chinese suppliers have achieved near-total market control through vertical integration and cost innovation. 
•	Market Share Concentration. Hesai (30% global share), RoboSense (29%), Huawei (24%), and Seyond control 92% of passenger car LiDAR revenues . Huawei's meteoric rise (from near-zero to $2 in 2 years) stems from deep integration with Seres (Aito), Chery (Luxeed), and Changan (Avatr).
•	Technology Leadership. Transition from 905nm EELs to VCSEL arrays and SPAD-SoC receivers enables **300m range** and **24M points/sec resolution** at mass-market costs. Huawei's 96-line LiDAR and RoboSense's M-platform sensors set global benchmarks
•	OEM Standardization. BYD's ""God's Eye"" (Feb 2025) brings LiDAR to C-segment EVs, while Li Auto will equip all 2025 models with LiDAR – a potential industry tipping point

a5033253-c954-4ec0-8b0b-9a50026d3b9c,"Objective:
Conduct a comprehensive, evidence-based investigation into the manufacturing and Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) risks for ETNB (pegozafermin, 89bio) and compare them to those for AKRO (efruxifermin, Akero Therapeutics), with a primary focus on factors impacting Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). The research should provide a detailed, side-by-side analysis of both companies’ manufacturing strategies, CMC challenges, and the implications for COGS, including scalability, supply chain resilience, regulatory compliance, and process complexity.

Key Research Areas and Questions:

1. Manufacturing Process Overview and Complexity
Describe the manufacturing process for ETNB (pegozafermin) and AKRO (efruxifermin):
What are the key steps, technologies, and unique features (e.g., glycoPEGylation for ETNB, lyophilization for AKRO)?
What are the main differences in formulation (liquid vs. lyophilized, device presentation, etc.) and how do these impact manufacturing cost and complexity? 8 10 11 22 29 30
Assess the scalability and robustness of each process:
Have large-scale GMP runs been completed? What evidence exists for successful scale-up? 8 14 30
What are the main technical risks (e.g., aggregation, stability, yield, operator error, reagent supply)? 2 3 7 8 15 16 22 23 24 31 32
2. Supply Chain Structure and Resilience
Map the supply chain for each product:
Who are the key contract manufacturers (e.g., BTPH, BiBo for ETNB; Boehringer Ingelheim, Vetter for AKRO)? Where are facilities located? 3 7 8 14 20 21 29 30
What are the risks related to geographic concentration, political/regulatory exposure (e.g., China, BIOSECURE Act), and single-source dependencies? 3 12 13 19 20 21 29 30
Evaluate contractual and financial commitments:
What are the terms of major supply agreements (e.g., milestone payments, cost overrun responsibilities, royalty structures)? 4 8 26 29 30
How do these commitments affect COGS and profit margins?
3. Regulatory and CMC Compliance Risks
Summarize regulatory feedback and CMC requirements:
What feedback has been received from FDA/EMA regarding CMC for each product? 40 42 47
Have commercial-scale facilities been inspected/approved by regulators? What are the risks of non-compliance or delays? 3 12 15 16 24 31 32 44
Assess readiness for commercial launch:
Are there gaps in process validation, quality assurance, or supply chain qualification that could impact COGS or launch timelines? 9 14 22 23 24 31 32
4. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Analysis
Quantify and compare COGS drivers:
What are the main contributors to COGS for each product (raw materials, process complexity, fill-finish, device, royalties, etc.)? 5 6 8 22 23 24 29 30 37 38
How have recent manufacturing investments (e.g., $135M BiBo facility for ETNB) and milestone payments affected COGS? 4 6 8 14
Are there any disclosed COGS figures, gross profit data, or inventory turnover metrics for either company? 37 38 39
Evaluate scalability and future COGS trends:
What risks exist for cost overruns, supply disruptions, or process changes that could increase COGS? 3 7 13 14 15 16 19 20 21 22 23 24 28 29 30 31 32
How do formulation and device choices (liquid vs. lyophilized, prefilled syringe vs. dual-chamber) impact COGS and patient/physician adoption? 10 11 22 30
5. Competitive Positioning and Strategic Implications
Compare manufacturing and CMC risk profiles:
Which company is better positioned to manage COGS and supply chain risks at commercial scale?
How do manufacturing and CMC risks affect each company’s ability to compete on price, margin, and market access? 8 30
Identify any unique differentiators or vulnerabilities:
Are there process or supply chain features that provide a durable cost or risk advantage to either ETNB or AKRO? 8 10 11 22 30
Deliverables:

A detailed, side-by-side comparative report addressing each of the above research areas.
Tables summarizing key manufacturing steps, supply chain partners, regulatory milestones, and COGS drivers for both ETNB and AKRO.
A risk matrix highlighting the most significant manufacturing and CMC risks for each product, with specific attention to COGS impact.
Recommendations for further diligence or monitoring based on identified gaps or uncertainties.

a85862ee-d27d-4688-9743-cc5a9bb41f46,"We see limited upside for BTS despite positive near term headlines
Under the policy, we expect BTS to benefit from higher farebox revenue at the Pink/Yellow lines (75% equity stake) and the Green line core network (33% equity stake). However, given that the ridership for the Pink/Yellow lines of 43,472 and 59,529 per day (May 25) are still far below breakeven levels of 180,000 and 160,000 per day, we believe the potential increase in ridership may only provide limited uplift to BTS earnings in FY26-27F. Moreover, the fare cap is currently set to be ineffective for only one year, and based on our understanding, the scheme would need a budget of THB7bn p.a. to implement which raises concerns over fiscal sustainability if the government wants to implement it in the long run. BTS may not necessarily benefit meaningfully from this scheme if passenger demand proves to be less price sensitive than expected and BTS may also need to share incremental revenue with the government. Note that our THB1/share upside will only materialise when the government converts BTS’s PPP net cost contracts into operate & maintenance contract (O&M). More details in our previous report. 
Direction remains unclear for VGI despite is large cash pile
In Dec 24, VGI (VGI TB; not rated), BTS’s 33% owned subsidiary, raised THB12.9bn through new share issuance via private placements. According to VGI, the company initially planned to invest in new businesses including virtual banking and entertainment complex. However, following its failed bidding for virtual banking licenses and the government step back from the entertainment complex bill, VGI is left directionless with regards to its new business direction. Due to the lack of additional business and soft macroeconomic environment in Thailand which bodes ill on VGI’s advertising business, we expect VGI’s ROE to remain depressed over the next 12 months.

The company also demonstrates a commitment to health and occupational safety, offering regular medical examinations and organizing initiatives such as a vaccination campaign during the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in a vaccination rate exceeding 90%. Additionally, va-Q-tec held a Health Day in December 2022 to further promote employee well-being 1.

During the pandemic, va-Q-tec actively supported social development by organizing health-related initiatives and maintaining a strong focus on employee care and community responsibility",integrate_search,user,normal,Ray Kwok,ray.kwok@cgsi.com,general,CGS International,19350.0,2025-07-17 04:10:50+00:00,active,,2025-06-10,,

These systems leverage high-definition maps and sensors (cameras and radar) to manage lane changes, overtaking, and toll navigation. Disadvantage: However, its reliance on pre-mapped routes limits effectiveness in unstructured scenarios such as construction zones. Urban NOA, in contrast, tackles complex city environments, including intersections and pedestrian-dense areas. Disadvantage of City NOA: Despite advancements, Urban NOA faces challenges due to high computational demands and sensor costs. Companies like Li Auto, Xpeng Motors, Huawei and others at the forefront of developing and implementing Urban NOA systems that do not rely on high-definition maps. This approach aims to overcome the limitations, such as their high collection costs, limited coverage, and the need for frequent updates.

The future of wine as a product and an asset class is the subject to much speculation. At an industry level, there is some debate about whether the global alcohol industry is facing structural adjustment or merely a reset after a massive spike during covid. Discuss
A “demand vacuum” has emerged post COVID. Alcohol sales have had a reset after a massive spike during COVID. Visually and empirically, it looks like current 12 MAT growth trends would sit on a “line of best fit” with historical (pre-2020) growth about to resume! However, there are those who believe the reset is some systemic change in human behaviour! Discuss
The emergence of a new generation of consumers: including the under 40yo cohort but not exclusively, interested in alcohol-free lifestyles is fuelling growth in low and no-alcohol alternatives. Discuss   
Despite the” booz is dead” narrative and concerns alcohol is having a” tobacco moment”, it remains one of the most durable consumer categories with consumption occasions linked to social settings.  In Western markets in particular, there is shift from formal, high-profile drinking occasions to more casual and spontaneous settings which favours wine types like rosé wine and Prosecco.
Is wine a fashion business?
Is wine going out of fashion?
Penfolds approach to wine making is to achieve a consistent house style over terrior expression.
What does moderation and changing consumption patterns mean for mass market wine?
Will alcohol remain a social lubricant?
Can fine wine be positioned as a luxury good?",reasoning_r1,user,deep_research,Matthew Brooks,matthew.brooks@macquarie.com,general,Macquarie,,2025-06-16 02:43:55+00:00,active,,2025-06-10,onboarded,

During this process, two trends have emerged: an increased demand for numbers of LiDAR installation
and the higher requirements for products’ performance, size, price and etc. Digital LiDARs are replacing
the layout of traditional discrete LiDARs. Benefiting from the leading advantages of our digital LiDAR
products, we entered into an important partnership with DiDi Autonomous Driving in April this year.
Its new generation of L4 Robotaxi vehicles developed in collaboration with Guangzhou Automobile
Group (GAC) will be equipped with six pieces of RoboSense’s automotive-grade fully solid-state digital
LiDARs. During the Auto Shanghai 2025, Pony.ai and RoboSense deepened our strategic cooperation
by announcing that the seventh-generation Robotaxi would be fitted with four pieces of RoboSense’s
automotive-grade fully solid-state digital LiDARs. This shows that our digital LiDAR products have
become a preferred choice for our L4 autonomous driving partners in deploying their new-generation
Robotaxi vehicles. Over 90% of the major global Robotaxi and Robotruck players have partnered with
us. Among them, six have signed formal mass-production cooperation agreements with us, including
well-known brands in the industry, such as Pony.ai, WeRide, DiDi Autonomous Driving, and a leading L4
autonomous driving company in Silicon Valley, USA. With the mass production of Robotaxi vehicles, this
emerging market is set to become an important growth driver for RoboSense’s business.
Automotive sector is one of the many applications for RoboSense’s LiDARs, and is the first market
in which we have achieved mass-production breakthroughs. Meanwhile, we have been exploring
our business in robotics sector which has applications with potential market size as large as that of
automotive sector.
Firstly, the Company has made breakthroughs in the garden robots market. According to Market
Research, the global lawn mower robot market size is projected to surge to USD3.9 billion by 2029. At
present, we have secured exclusive partnerships with two global leading lawn mower robot manufactures.
In May 2025, we officially announced that we have established a strategic partnership with Mammotion
Technologies. This partnership has created a record of the largest order for LiDAR in the lawn mower
robot industry to date. We are going to deliver 1.2 million units of automotive-grade fully-solid-state
LiDARs over the next three years for the development of the perception system of high-end intelligent
lawn mower robots. By leveraging RoboSense’s E-Platform digital solid-state LiDAR technology,
our LiDARs are able to have stronger courtyard environment perception capabilities so as to achieve
centimeter-precise automatic lawn mowing operations. With the leading-edge effect of the launch of our
first product, we are confident in establishing close partnerships with more garden robots companies in
the future and continuing to launch more customized products to meet diverse needs and requirements.",integrate_search,user,normal,Ray Kwok,ray.kwok@cgsi.com,general,CGS International,32823.0,2025-07-10 04:07:39+00:00,active,,2025-06-10,,

 The freeze of Akulaku Finance Indonesia (AFI) from disbursing new loans by the Financial Services Authority (OJK) from Oct 23 to Mar 24 still plays a significant role in the loan growth for BBYB, as BBYB currently is still in progress to resume loan channeling through AFI. As of 1Q25, loan channeling AFI proportion has decreased to 37% of BBYB’s loan book (vs. 55% in 1Q24). In the meantime, the bank tapped into the corporate and commercial segment, which has shown significant growth in the past one year (+150% yoy to Rp2.5tr as of 1Q25). BBYB is also pushing for growth through its direct digital lending product, but it currently only accounts for xx% of its loan book. However, despite BBYB’s effort to grow its corporate and commercial loan book, the bank is still experiencing an overall decline of 4.8% yoy as of Apr 25. We believe it will take some time before BBYB can grow its overall loan book, specifically the P2P channeling segment, as they are still waiting for OJK approval to resume its channeling through AFI and new non-AFI channeling partners.

Disadvantage: However, its reliance on pre-mapped routes limits effectiveness in unstructured scenarios such as construction zones. 
Urban NOA, in contrast, tackles complex city environments, including intersections and pedestrian-dense areas. 
Disadvantage of City NOA: Despite advancements, Urban NOA faces challenges due to high computational demands and sensor costs. Companies like Li Auto, Xpeng Motors, Huawei and others at the forefront of developing and implementing Urban NOA systems that do not rely on high-definition maps. This approach aims to overcome the limitations, such as their high collection costs, limited coverage, and the need for frequent updates. Companies like Huawei and Xpeng use AI-driven systems to enable navigation in over 45 cities.

""Domestic Chip Development Status
Chinese companies have made uneven progress in different LiDAR chip components. While Chinese transmitter VCSEL (Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser) chips have entered a mature mass production phase, receiver SPAD chips remain largely dominated by international players like Sony and ON Semiconductor 37.
Several Chinese firms are actively working to bridge this gap. Companies including Fortsense, Sophoton, VisionICs Microelectronics Technology, and ADAPS are investing heavily in SPAD chip development. For example, in August 2023, Fortsense released FL6031, an all-solid-state LiDAR area array SPAD chip using the Stacked-BSI process, integrating over 50,000 effective pixels to meet automotive application requirements 37.
Sony's IMX459 stacked SPAD depth sensor, released for automotive LiDAR applications using direct Time-of-Flight method, represents the key competition for these emerging Chinese solutions 38
Addressing Unique Local Driving Scenarios
Chinese ADAS chip manufacturers are increasingly focusing on optimizing their algorithms for local driving conditions, which present unique challenges compared to Western markets. The rapid growth of the Chinese ADAS market-evidenced by Li Auto's reported 182% increase in unit deliveries in 2023-demonstrates the market's maturation and demand for localized solutions13. 
Global Leaders: NVIDIA and Qualcomm
NVIDIA’s Orin-X (254 TOPS) dominates China’s premium EV sector, powering NIO ET7’s NOP+ and XPeng XNGP systems 15  16. Its CUDA cores (specialized processing units) enable real-time training of neural networks using crowd-sourced driving data from 480,000+ vehicles 15. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Ride Flex targets mid-range models with 45 TOPS at 10W, offering OTA-upgradable ADAS features for BYD’s Seal DM-i17. 

China’s ADAS chipset sector is undergoing rapid transformation as local firms aggressively erode the market positions of international leaders amidst geopolitically driven supply chain shifts.
With accelerated domestic innovation and localisation, Chinese chipmakers are set to further increase their market share, intensifying pressure on foreign incumbents as full-stack, scalable, and cost-optimized solutions become the new competitive paradigm, in our view.""

The Strategy's investment philosophy targets complex opportunities with asymmetric payoff profiles in businesses we like. We drive solutions that unlock value by reducing complexity premia by blending structuring expertise with deep fundamental convictions and a sound relative value framework.

Investment Approach
All-weather, evergreen approach fundamentally driven to invest in undervalued or mispriced securities by targeting high risk-adjusted returns with favorable asymmetrical payoff profiles.
Opportunistic approach combines deep fundamental credit analysis with special situations capabilities to harvest complexity premia through a varying mix of event driven, relative value and credit shorting strategies.
Systematic approach utilizes PGIM Fixed Income’s +1,000 active lending relationships and expansive credit research coverage universe (+2,000 issuers) to capitalize on idiosyncratic or industry dislocations or to provide transitional capital for turnaround purposes or growth objectives.
Strategy maximizes rebalancing liquidity to flex across all phases of the credit cycle to invest in the full spectrum of credit opportunities from relative value trading across performing credit markets to bespoke financing solutions.

I hope you're doing well!
Please kindly find attached the updated data for 4W discount as of June-25 and auto tracker as of May-25.
Key findings for 4W discount:
The overall discount percentage (from out tracker) decreased by 0.5% mom, which we suspect was due to defending margin as car sales remained relatively weak.
Honda and Toyota experienced a slight decline in the nominal discount amount during the month, at 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively, while other brands remained relatively similar. 
We suspect Honda discount looks smaller as they just introduced their new HRV, while Toyota discount decreased to protect their overall margin.
BYD sales still remain solid (above its average monthly sales from Jan to Apr 25). The brand hasn't offered a discount on their 2025 cars, however, for the 2024 BYD Seal, we did notice a significant amount of discount on top of the plan to introduce a new version this year (up to Rp100m).",integrate_search,user,normal,Jason Chandra,jason.chandra@cgsi.com,general,CGS International,,2025-06-23 07:48:41+00:00,active,,2025-06-10,onboarded,onboarded
